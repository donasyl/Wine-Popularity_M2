J. Lohr 2000 Hilltop Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),J. Lohr,Red,Hilltop Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",,$32,87,,"Held back nearly five years, this Cab still has some sturdy tannins, but I would drink it now because the fruit's in a precarious position. It's rich and tasty now in black currants and cherries, but too soft to age."
Antucura 2010 Pinot Noir (Vista Flores),Antucura,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Vista Flores, Mendoza Province, Argentina",15%,$17,85,Michael Schachner,"Rubbery, bold and earthy on the nose, then full and sticky in the mouth, with sweet black fruit flavors. Tastes more like a Bordeaux red wine than textbook Pinot Noir courtesy of heavy extraction, darkness and oak. Tastes good but could use a lesson in elegance and restraint."
Quinta do Portal 1999 Quinta do Portal Reserva Red (Douro),Quinta do Portal,Red,Quinta do Portal Reserva,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Douro, Portugal",,,90,Roger Voss,"Smoky, meaty aromas lead into perfumed fruit flavors. The tannins are soft but dry; the fruit is very aromatic with a touch of violets and some rich, dark tannins underneath. The wine will age well—probably 5–10 years. —R.V."
Tenuta di Ghizzano 2006 Il Ghizzano Red (Toscana),Tenuta di Ghizzano,Red,Il Ghizzano,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$18,86,,"The nose is rather neutral save for distant aromas of cherry fruit, boysenberry and spice. However, the mouthfeel is more interesting thanks to the wine's chewy succulence and fresh, zesty close: An 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot."
Tenuta San Francesco 2007 Tramonti White (Campania),Tenuta San Francesco,White,Tramonti,White Blend,"Campania, Southern Italy, Italy",13.5%,$21,85,,"This intriguing blend of Falanghina, Biancolella and Pepella (three relatively unknown indigenous grapes) has a candy- or soda-like quality that recalls butterscotch and caramel. However, those notes are balanced by an elegant mineral tone and the wine has good dimension on the close."
Las Positas 2011 Estate Barbera (Livermore Valley),Las Positas,Red,Estate,Barbera,"Livermore Valley, Central Coast, California, US",15.1%,$40,89,Virginie Boone,"This is a hefty Barbera, replete with dark, brooding layers of rich cinnamon and anise, especially aromatically, and a chewy texture. Structured, it's leathery yet juicy, touched by oak, with a suggestion of petrol on the finish. But with Nonna's lasagne? Great."
Krupp Brothers 2007 The Doctor Red (Napa Valley),Krupp Brothers,Red,The Doctor,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15.1%,$60,92,,"An ambitious blend of Merlot, Tempranillo, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, grown mainly on Atlas Peak. It's bone dry and locked down in tannins and acidity, offering little relief, but there's a potent core of blackberries and black currants that yearns to bust through. Clearly well grown, it could be an ager, but predictions are risky."
Yvon Mau NV Premius Brut Rosé  (Crémant de Bordeaux),Yvon Mau,Sparkling,Premius Brut Rosé,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Crémant de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",12%,$19,88,Roger Voss,"Made in a traditional style, this is a fruity, crisp blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. With its freshness allied to the attractive strawberry flavors, the wine has both a ripe character and a buoyant mousse and aftertaste. Drink now."
Gunter Triebaumer 2006 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),Gunter Triebaumer,Red,,"Blaufränkisch, Other Red","Burgenland, Austria",13%,$16,87,Roger Voss,"A big, ripe wine, full of berry fruits and rhubarb, edged with tannins, spice and red plum skins. It has a juicy, rich quality, enhanced by acidity, and rounded with vanilla. Keep for a year. Screwcap."
Ata Rangi 2016 Crimson Pinot Noir (Martinborough),Ata Rangi,Red,Crimson,Pinot Noir,"Martinborough, New Zealand",13.5%,$30,89,Christina Pickard,"Founder Clive Paton is a keen conservationist, and proceeds from the sale of this wine go toward Project Crimson, which replants threatened red-flowering trees around New Zealand. The nose is a little reductive, requiring a few minutes to get going in the glass, but when it does, it's quite fragrant, with bright red berry fruit, potpourri, floral, pepper and sap characters. It's medium bodied, and the juicy, slippery fruit is tightly wound with sappy, earthy tannins and slightly bitter oak spice. Drink now–2024."
Merry Edwards 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),Merry Edwards,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$32,88,,"Despite a chilly vintage, the winery successfully avoiding the green fruit that plagues so much Sauvignon Blanc from 2011. While the wine is dry, it's rich in citrus, pear, tropical fruit and honey flavors, with a touch of spicy oak."
Kaiken 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),Kaiken,Red,Reserva,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.5%,$13,87,Michael Schachner,"Brushy aromas of wild herbs along with cherry and plum scents feed into a fresh, fairly full palate. This is generously oaked for basic Malbec, and thus spice and resin notes share the stage with plum and blackberry flavors. A dry, spicy, resiny finish is the close."
Château le Prieuré 2007 Grand Cru Classé  (Saint-Émilion),Château le Prieuré,Red,Grand Cru Classé,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,$42,89,Roger Voss,"Situated on the plateau of Saint-Emilion, just east of the city, Château le Prieuré has produced a finely structured 2007, not big, but well balanced. Touches of cocoa and cinnamon spice cap the solid fruit and dry tannins. Age for 3–4 years."
Casa da Passarella 2012 Colheita Tinto Red (Dão),Casa da Passarella,Red,Colheita Tinto,Portuguese Red,"Dão, Portugal",13.5%,$15,88,Roger Voss,"A fresh and fruity, juicy wine that is just touched by the tannins and structure of the Dão region. It is a wine to be consumed young for its berry fruits and perfumed acidity. Drink now."
Leone de Castris 2018 Il Medaglione Primitivo (Salento),Leone de Castris,Red,Il Medaglione,"Primitivo, Zinfandel","Salento, Southern Italy, Italy",13.5%,$15,88,Alexander Peartree,"Aromas of blood orange, baked plum and cherry are lifted by potpourri spice on the nose. Rounded and juicy on the palate, a succulent red fruit jam flavor is honed by racy acidity and fine-grained tannins."
Jidvei 2015 Demisec Gewurztraminer (Jidvei),Jidvei,White,Demisec,"Gewürztraminer, Gewürztraminer","Jidvei, Romania",12.5%,$10,86,Jeff Jenssen,"This semisweet wine has a flowery bouquet of jasmine and citrus blossom. The florality continues to the palate, combining with flavors of pineapple, ginger and apricot before a slightly sweet finish."
Herdade do Rocim 2014 Vale da Mata Reserva Red (Lisboa),Herdade do Rocim,Red,Vale da Mata Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Lisboa, Portugal",13.5%,$35,94,Roger Voss,"From a small vineyard owned by the Vieira family for several generations, this wine is dense, impressive and packed with rich black fruits. Its tannins and smoky, tarry character are now almost mature, and the result is very fine. This major wine will be ready to drink from 2020."
Daou 2015 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Daou,Red,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$56,92,Matt Kettmann,"Deep and dark aromas of black currant, elderberry jam, dark chocolate and an elegant layering of herbs show on the nose of this bottling. There's a dense frame of opulent black cherry and purple flowers on the sip, which is framed by upright yet smooth tannins."
Laetitia 1999 La Colline Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),Laetitia,Red,La Colline,Pinot Noir,"Arroyo Grande Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$60,92,,"There's a complex mélange of aromas and flavors that one taster felt incorporated too many citrus and vegetal notes, but the rest of the panel enjoyed the cherry, herb, cocoa, cinnamon, citrus and olive notes. Smooth and polished, this combines structure and immediate appeal. Good now, but best after 2004."
Bouchard Père & Fils 2008 Ancienne Cuvée Carnot Caillerets Premier Cru  (Volnay),Bouchard Père & Fils,Red,Ancienne Cuvée Carnot Caillerets Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Volnay, Burgundy, France",,$85,92,Roger Voss,"Structured and concentrated, it has a silky richness that is very Volnay, while at the same time giving the bright fruits of the year. The final tastes are smoke and crisp acidity."
Winery of Good Hope 2011 Bush Vine Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),Winery of Good Hope,White,Bush Vine,Chenin Blanc,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",13%,$12,86,Lauren Buzzeo,"This wine shows good balance between the lively acidity and ripe notes of red apple flesh, pear and orange oil. The round mouthfeel of ripe fruit flavors are lifted on the finish by a tangy, green plum and lime zest accent. Drink now."
Château de Fieuzal 2013  Pessac-Léognan,Château de Fieuzal,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,$50,89,Roger Voss,"The enthusiastic use of wood for this wine gives a dark, spicy character that masks any fruit. Less new wood would have helped highlight the natural fruitiness of the wine. Leave it until 2020 and the fruit may fill out. Winemaker Stephan Carrier returned from Napa to take over winemaking after Irish businessman Lochlann Quinn bought the property in 2001."
Testarossa 2015 Tondre Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Testarossa,Red,Tondre Grapefield,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$65,93,Matt Kettmann,"Plump mulberry and black plum aromas are generous but reserved enough on the edges to keep it elegant, lifted by spicebox and sweet tobacco touches. Lovely layers of flavors explode on the palate, with a strong spicy character lifting the core of dark red fruit. There's also an earthy flavor, and perfect acidity binding it all together."
A.A. Badenhorst Family Wines 2015 Ramnasgras Cinsault (Swartland),A.A. Badenhorst Family Wines,Red,Ramnasgras,"Cinsault, Other Red","Swartland, South Africa",11%,$40,90,Lauren Buzzeo,"Notes of rosehip, clove, nutmeg, red currant, rhubarb and wild strawberry all abound on the nose and mouth in this fresh, vibrant wine. Fine tannins lend a soft structure to the medium-weight palate, with bright acidity providing freshness and levity. Hints of Dr. Pepper and tart red currant ride out the mouthwatering close. Drink now–2021."
Château Potelle 2000 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),Château Potelle,Red,,Zinfandel,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",,$22,85,,"This fine Napa producer has set up a Paso Robles operation and here is the result. This is a soft, hot country Zin, with plummy, raisiny flavors, considerable alcohol, and nonexistent tannins. The wine is dry, with a fruity finish."
Wombat Gully 2001 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),Wombat Gully,Red,,,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",12.6%,$10,84,Michael Schachner,"Tight in the nose, with hints of tomato and black plum. The flavors veer toward plum and cherry, as there's quite a lot of fruit here. Furthermore, it's nice and easy on the palate. Some toasty oak appears on the finish, which is buttery and fairly long. —M.S."
Sallier de la Tour 2017 Inzolia (Sicilia),Sallier de la Tour,White,,"Inzolia, Italian White","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",12%,$13,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"This 100% Inzolia has aromas of Bosc pear, white flower and Granny Smith apple. The aromas carry over to the easy-drinking palate accompanied by bright acidity that gives the wine a refreshing close."
Château Coutet 2004  Barsac,Château Coutet,Dessert,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Barsac, Bordeaux, France",,,94,Roger Voss,"A fresh, delicious wine, the natural richness of the botrytis balanced beautifully with acidity. It is ripe but delicate, a style that floats over the sweet fruit."
Melville 2002 Clone 76 - Inox Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),Melville,White,Clone 76 - Inox,Chardonnay,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",,$28,86,,"An entirely unoaked wine designed to showcase its terroir, which it does in the tartly crisp acidity and streamlined citrus and apple flavors. The wine drinks severe and steely sharp. The bottle I tasted was also a little fizzy."
Geyser Peak 1999 Reserve Alexandre Meritage Red (Alexander Valley),Geyser Peak,Red,Reserve Alexandre Meritage,"Cabernet Blend, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13%,$45,93,,"The quintessential Alexander Valley Cabernet, always dependably soft, fruity and complex. This year is one of the best ever. Plush and velvety, with endless nuances, it's like sipping the essence of black cherries steeped in kirsch. Dry, with just enough oak to add smoke and spice. Editors' Choice. —S.H."
Leonetti Cellar 2018 Holy Roller Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Leonetti Cellar,Red,Holy Roller,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$138,94,Sean P. Sullivan,"Coming from the winery's plantings in the Rocks District, this wine is 83% Cabernet and 17% Sangiovese. The aromas are redolent with notes of dark fruit, dried herbs, moist earth, flowers, cocoa and spice. The black fruit flavors are dense and supple, displaying impressive intensity and more structure than is often associated with this region. The finish shows exceptionally long hang time."
Chalk Hill 2005 Botrytised Sémillon (Chalk Hill),Chalk Hill,Dessert,Botrytised,Sémillon,"Chalk Hill, Sonoma, California, US",11%,$55,95,,"This is one of the sweetest white California dessert wines out there. It's addictively decadent, like an upscale Sauternes. Barrel fermentation in new French oak gives an opulent, palate-flattering honeyed vanilla richness to the apricot, peach, pineapple and crème brûlée flavors that are so rich and refined. Crisp acidity provide clean, vibrant balance. Just gorgeous, and worth the price."
Brokenwood 2008 Cricket Pitch Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz-Merlot-Petit Verdot Red (South Eastern Australia),Brokenwood,Red,Cricket Pitch Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz-Merlot-Petit Verdot,"Red Blends, Red Blends","South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",14%,$21,87,Joe Czerwinski,"Dark hints of charred oak and cola accent bright berry aromas, while the palate is marked by bold berry and black cherry flavors and a whack of vanilla. It's a medium-bodied red that comes across as a bit hard-edged because of its acidity despite having rather soft tannins. Drink now."
Silver Palm 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast),Silver Palm,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"North Coast, North Coast, California, US",13.7%,$19,86,Jim Gordon,"Jammy aromas, figgy flavors and a very smooth mouthfeel define this medium-bodied and straightforward wine. Without much of the typical tannins, it's easy on the palate."
Tittarelli 2003 Reserva de Familia Tempranillo (Mendoza),Tittarelli,Red,Reserva de Familia,Tempranillo,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$20,80,Michael Schachner,"The color and aromas stir intrigue, but the brutally sharp palate that runs on steam-roller acidity does it no favors. Succulent to the point of sour, and giant to the point of overdone, this wine needs to head back to the garage for a tune-up."
Innocent Bystander 2005 Shiraz-Viognier (South Eastern Australia),Innocent Bystander,Red,,,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",14.5%,$20,90,Joe Czerwinski,"This may only be a medium-bodied red, but it crackles with the exciting flavors of the northern Rhône, marrying freshly cracked peppercorns with a hint of meatiness and bright blueberry fruit. Drink now."
Angeline 2006 Gewürztraminer (Mendocino County),Angeline,White,,Gewürztraminer,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",13.1%,$14,89,,"Well-acidified, the fruit shows a long hangtime character of marvelously intense tropical fruits, spices and flowers. The wine spreads a honeyed richness all around the mouth, but it's dry."
Cellers Unió 2014 Roureda Llicorella Clàssic Red (Priorat),Cellers Unió,Red,Roureda Llicorella Clàssic,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Priorat, Catalonia, Spain",14.5%,$25,90,Michael Schachner,"Drilling aromas of graphite and balsamic dark fruits open this intense, pulling blend of 50% Carignan, 25% Garnacha and 15% Merlot. Roaring berry, chocolate and pepper flavors get brushed aside by the tannic roughness of the finish. Give this plenty of air before pouring; drink through 2024."
Dopff Au Moulin 2017 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),Dopff Au Moulin,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$14,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A shy nose gives only slight glimpses of russet-pear peel and earth. The palate emphasizes a textural, earthy element with lemon crispness and finishes refreshingly dry and bright."
Palivou 2004 Ammos Terra Leone Single Vineyard Selection Agiorgitiko (Nemea),Palivou,Red,Ammos Terra Leone Single Vineyard Selection,"Agiorgitiko, Greek Red","Nemea, Greece",14%,$45,87,Susan Kostrzewa,"A darker, denser red that offers chocolate, black fruit and spice on the nose and palate. A spin of nutty spice and dried fruit punctuates the cherry and raisin fruit. Slightly Port-like and heavier, this wine will soften with time in the bottle."
La Ganghija 2015  Barbaresco,La Ganghija,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$45,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of rose petal, red berry and tobacco lead the way. The juicy palate offers raspberry, white pepper and star anise set against firm tannins. Drink 2021–2029."
Château Pavie 2015 Arômes de Pavie Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),Château Pavie,Red,Arômes de Pavie Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,92,Roger Voss,"91–93. Barrel Sample. Spicy and ripe, this wine has a strong structure of brooding tannins. There are also great black plum and blackberry flavors here that are super-ripe."
Wyndham Estate 2007 Bin 333 Pinot Noir (South Eastern Australia),Wyndham Estate,Red,Bin 333,Pinot Noir,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",13%,$9,86,,"Wyndham 333 delivers fabulous Pinot aromas of cherry, raspberry and mineral at a very modest price. The palate is serious, with lovely strawberry flavors but falls a bit flat on the plush finish. Drink up."
Château d'Aydie 2009  Madiran,Château d'Aydie,Red,,"Tannat, Other Red","Madiran, Southwest France, France",14%,$35,92,Roger Voss,"A new-wood-dominated wine, this has a heavy toast character, with extracted licorice and dark chocolate flavors as well as a big black-plum note. Rich and weighty, with juicy acidity, this demands many years of aging."
Kopke 2003 Colheita White  (Port),Kopke,Port/Sherry,Colheita White,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,$51,89,Roger Voss,"Almost a baby in Colheita Port terms, this is a bright, ripe and fruity wine. It does have some touches of wood aging although they are left behind by the honey and orange marmalade flavors that have a light sprinkling of ginger. Drink now."
Chimney Rock 2005 Elevage Blanc White (Stags Leap District),Chimney Rock,White,Elevage Blanc,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Stags Leap District, Napa, California, US",13.5%,$39,92,,"Lots to like in this dry, elegant wine, which is a Graves-style blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon. The flavors are quite complex, with nectarine, peach, pineapple and flowery buttercup accented with a nutty, cashew-rich oiliness. All that richness is perfectly balanced with crisp acidity."
Bellora 2016  Soave,Bellora,White,,"Garganega, Italian White","Soave, Veneto, Italy",12.5%,,85,Kerin O’Keefe,Fruity aromas of tropical fruit and white peach carry over to the simple palate along with the barest hint of bitter almond. Fresh acidity gives it a bright finish.
Bovio 2017  Barolo,Bovio,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$50,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with spicy aromas of incense and star anise that mingle with cedar and eucalyptus. The chewy palate offers dried cherry, licorice and tobacco alongside solid, somewhat grainy tannins. Drink through 2027."
Philo Ridge 2009 Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Philo Ridge,Red,Unfiltered,Pinot Noir,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14.1%,$34,87,Virginie Boone,"A light yet concentrated Pinot Noir, this has a cherry flavor and a spicy texture. Give it some air to allow the better side of its earthy aromas time to unravel."
Tertulia 2010 Redd Brand BDX Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Tertulia,Red,Redd Brand BDX,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.1%,$15,87,Sean P. Sullivan,"It's the Carmenère (14%) that pops first on this Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc-dominant blend. Aromas of braised jalapeno pepper are followed by coffee, vanilla and dark fruit. The coffee and cherry flavors are light, with some grit to the tannins and a warm finish."
Perelada 2017 Stars Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),Perelada,Sparkling,Stars Reserva Brut Nature,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Cava, Catalonia, Spain",11.5%,,88,Michael Schachner,"Yeasty aromas of freshly baked white bread are lightly toasted but short on fruit. On the palate, this brut nature is dry, crisp and hints at minerality. Flavors of fresh green herbs and citrus fruits precede a light finish."
McPherson 2015 Timmons Ranch Marsanne (Texas),McPherson,White,Timmons Ranch,Marsanne,"Texas, Texas, US",13.6%,,87,Fiona Adams,"Aromas of lemon peel, crushed chalk and Golden Delicious apple lead to the dry chalky palate. The pithy finish offers hints of white pepper and river rock."
House of Nobilo 2007 Icon Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),House of Nobilo,White,Icon,Sauvignon Blanc,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13%,$20,90,Joe Czerwinski,"A pleasant step up for Nobilo's top-of-the-line Sauvignon, offering slightly smoky, herbal but balanced aromas and plenty of melon and stone fruit flavors. It's full-bodied and rich, with a long, refreshing, slightly herbal finish."
MAN Vintners 2006 Pinotage (Coastal Region),MAN Vintners,Red,,Pinotage,"$10,Buy Now",14%,$10,86,Susan Kostrzewa,"Pinotage's “love it or leave it” character—bright red fruit, plucky spice, a touch of rubber—is in full force here, meaning the wine will pair well with grilled meats and stews and is both fun and exotic. Flavors are balanced, acidity good, and the finish is dry and clean."
Kracher 2016 Nouvelle Vague Nummer 2 Trockenbeerenauslese Zweigelt (Burgenland),Kracher,Dessert,Nouvelle Vague Nummer 2 Trockenbeerenauslese,"Zweigelt, Other Red","Burgenland, Austria",10%,,98,Anne Krebiehl MW,"An intense streak of dark mint chocolate immediately hits the nose. This is followed by fruity notions of spirit-soaked plums. The palate concentrates on those plum flavors, with their luscious cinnamon-stoked aromas that are pervaded by a welcome freshness. That ethereal pervasive miny lift that was first encountered on the nose continues to add an extra dimension on this marvel of purity and flavor."
Lungarotti 2014 Extra Brut Sparkling (Vino Spumante),Lungarotti,Sparkling,Extra Brut,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Vino Spumante, Italy Other, Italy",12.5%,,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas suggesting toasted nut and a whiff of adhesive bandage form the subdued nose. On the lean and racy palate, brisk acidity accompanies suggestions of medicinal herb, lemon rind and bitter walnut."
Colgin 2006 IX Estate Red (Napa Valley),Colgin,Red,IX Estate,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15.6%,$290,94,,"From the estate, in the Pritchard Hill area of St. Helena which is worthy of its own appellation, comes this densely structured, impressive but young wine. It's massive in fruity extract and new oak, flooding the mouth with soft, ultrarich flavors of blackberries and dark chocolate and a leathery, peppery, grilled meat quality. This is the kind of wine even a non-red wine drinker will be dazzled by, and connoisseurs will appreciate its power and finesse. Ready now for sheer opulence, and should develop through 2012, at least."
Château Saint-Didier-Parnac 2011 Prieuré de Cénac  (Cahors),Château Saint-Didier-Parnac,Red,Prieuré de Cénac,Malbec,"Cahors, Southwest France, France",13.5%,$24,91,Roger Voss,"A dark, brooding wine, packed with firm tannins and solid plum-skin and licorice flavors. The wine is dense and complex—a powerful evocation of Malbec—allowing the juicy fruits to merge with the young structure that needs agng for at least 4–5 years."
Domaine Au Pied du Mont Chauve 2014 Le Charmois Premier Cru  (Saint-Aubin),Domaine Au Pied du Mont Chauve,Red,Le Charmois Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Saint-Aubin, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$40,90,Roger Voss,"This Picard family wine is still showing wood-aging flavors that contrast with the fresh red-cherry fruit and acidity that is light and perfumed. The wine still needs its balance, which will come in the next months. Drink from 2020."
Companhia das Quintas 2005 Quinta do Cardo Selecção do Enólogo Red (Beira Interior),Companhia das Quintas,Red,Quinta do Cardo Selecção do Enólogo,Portuguese Red,"Beira Interior, Portugal",13.5%,$15,92,Roger Voss,"Cool and tight, this is a firmly tannic wine, showing its mineral, primal rock character. The structure is dry, solid, the fruit a layer of cranberry and black fig among all this firmness. It should age, but is ready now."
Roth 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),Roth,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.8%,$17,84,,"Off-dry to sweetish, this has honey, orange, apricot, lime and vanilla flavors. It shows Sauvignon's clean, brisk acidity, but that taste of sweetness limits its appeal."
Château Rauzan Despagne 2016  Bordeaux,Château Rauzan Despagne,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$20,85,Roger Voss,"Acidity shows strongly in this wine along with the dry tannins. It has weight, suggesting ripe fruits that need to develop. Drink this wine from 2021."
Avignonesi 2006 Desiderio Merlot (Cortona),Avignonesi,Red,Desiderio,Merlot,"Cortona, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$57,93,,"Sweet spice aromas of cinnamon and vanilla come at the heels of bright berry fruit and cherries. This is a plush, modern Merlot (with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon for extra texture and dimension) that offers well-integrated layers of fruit and oak spice. The mouthfeel is round, soft and long-lasting."
Pear Valley 2013 Pear Valley Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),Pear Valley,Red,Pear Valley Vineyard,Zinfandel,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15%,$19,90,Matt Kettmann,"Rather elegant and well integrated aromas of stewed black cherries, clove, gingerbread and vanilla are reminiscent of a rich dessert. The palate is also full and flavorful with similar components as well as brown sugar, Vietnamese coffee, purple flowers and a lifting mint component. It's fruity but nuanced and fairly priced."
Argillae 2016 Grechetto (Umbria),Argillae,White,,"Grechetto, Italian White","Umbria, Central Italy, Italy",13%,$15,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Honeysuckle and yellow stone fruit aromas lead the nose of this wine.

It's rich and honeyed and feels so good in the mouth, carrying flavors of oranges, sweet limes, Meyer lemons, vanilla and toasty bread. Drink over the next six years."
Artadi 2011 Valdegines Single Vineyard  (Rioja),Artadi,Red,Valdegines Single Vineyard,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",14.5%,$65,93,Michael Schachner,"Ripe, savory and smoky up front, this is oozing blackberry, cassis, bacon and leather aromas. The palate on this minerally Rioja is as juicy, ripe and fresh as they come. Flavors of plum, berry, herbs and oak are integrated, classy and finish long, with a touch of coconut and raw wood that will likely disappear with more bottle age. Drink through 2025."
Cairdean Estate 2011 Syrah (Atlas Peak),Cairdean Estate,Red,,,"Atlas Peak, Napa, California, US",13.9%,$68,90,Virginie Boone,"A majority varietal, this wine also contains Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, combining for a taste of baked blackberry and licorice, the oak subtle in smoke. With a tannic bite on the midpalate, it resolves into smoother, velvety textures on the finish, inviting one in for another try."
Barnard Griffin 2003 Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA)),Barnard Griffin,Red,,Zinfandel,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$22,88,Paul Gregutt,"Very citrusy and lifted, forward, scented with orange and lemon peel, cranberry and orange flesh.

Marsiliana 2006 Birillo  (Maremma),Marsiliana,Red,Birillo,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Maremma, Tuscany, Italy",14%,,87,,"Birillo is a soft but straightforward red wine from southern Tuscany that would pair with roast chicken or stuffed turkey. It shows savory aromas of ripe fruit, cured meat, smoked beef and root beer."

Crisp, firm and snappy in the mouth, with berry, cherry and peppery herbal flavors and finish. Nothing but regular; decent for the price."
Falling Star 2002 Chardonnay (Mendoza),Falling Star,White,,Chardonnay,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",,$5,84,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of gumdrop, lemon juice and anise create a stylish impression, however, the wine turns more zesty and tangy in the mouth. Flavors of grapefruit, lemon and apple are open yet ultimately rather simple."
Wagner 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Wagner,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12.5%,$15,85,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Lush with aromas of ripe red plums and cherries with a hint of warm, golden toast, this is a charming everyday wine that's easy to drink yet offers a satisfying degree of depth. Bright acidity, tart Morello cherry flavors and soft tannins meld elegantly on the palate, leading to a finish that's rich with mocha and dark, toasted oak."
Apollonis NV Cuvée Authentique Meunier Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Meunier (Champagne),Apollonis,Sparkling,Cuvée Authentique Meunier Blanc de Noirs Brut,"Pinot Meunier, Other Red","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$50,91,Roger Voss,"It is no surprise that this producer situated in the Marne Valley has a predilection for Pinot Meunier. The Champagne with ripe fruits and a generous texture was, according to the producer, “cultivated with music.” The wine's freshness is exemplary and delicious. Drink now."
Daou 2012 AUX Red (Paso Robles),Daou,Red,AUX,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.8%,$65,92,Matt Kettmann,"Deep and dark blueberry aromas are laced with blackberry-balsamic reduction, black tobacco, black sage and a brooding spice character on this blend of 71% Syrah, 24% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre. It's thick and chewy on the palate, with ripe purple fruits clinging to a dense backbone of bacon fat and fudge."
Rigo Filippo - Ai Rabaj 2012 Duemiladodici  (Barbaresco),Rigo Filippo - Ai Rabaj,Red,Duemiladodici,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",,,85,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of sawdust, coconut and espresso lead the way while the palate offers raw sour cherry and just a hint of cinnamon. However, this completely lacks fruit richness and has an abrupt finish."
Oriel 2004 Ortolan Falkenstein Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),Oriel,White,Ortolan Falkenstein,Grüner Veltliner,"Weinviertel, Austria",12.5%,$20,84,Joe Czerwinski,"Although this wine starts well, with scents of lime, stone fruit, gunmetal and mineral oil, it never really gets going on the palate, where the understated flavors of peach and pear end on a citrusy note. Imported by USA Wine Imports."

Montelle 2007 Dry Vignoles (Missouri),Montelle,White,Dry,"Vignoles, Other White","Missouri, Missouri, US",12%,$10,84,Susan Kostrzewa,"This Missouri Vignoles offers a nose of orange Muscat, pepper and warming spice, followed by slightly sweet flavors (despite its dry designation) of apricot, pineapple and citrus. Balanced acidity and a pleasant, round mouthfeel. The finish is substantial, with a spicy flair."
Wilridge 2011 Rosebud Vineyard Viognier (Yakima Valley),Wilridge,White,Rosebud Vineyard,Viognier,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.5%,$16,89,Paul Gregutt,"Viognier is a clear success story for Wilridge. This is not a flashy wine, and it goes down easily. It's deeply concentrated, with a rich core of peach, apricot and lemon drop flavors."
Efeste 2012 Jolie Bouche Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),Efeste,Red,Jolie Bouche Boushey Vineyard,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",15%,$44,94,Sean P.

Paco Garcia 2008 Beautiful Things  (Rioja),Paco Garcia,Red,Beautiful Things,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$55,89,Michael Schachner,"Earthy, oaky, leathery berry and spice aromas come around nicely with airing. This is a plump Rioja with modern leanings; it has good structure and pretty raspberry and cassis flavors. A round finish hints at raisiny maturity but doesn't overdo the ripeness. Drink through 2015."

At this stage, the wine is all texture, with its green and white fruits suppressed. There is a vivid, vibrant character, which promises aging over the next 4–5 years. Imported by Cellar Door Selections."
Robert Hall 2001 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),Robert Hall,Red,,Zinfandel,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.7%,$24,85,,"Blackberry, sage and thyme flavors are at the core of this wine. It's a bit herbal, but well-balanced nonetheless, showing moderate length on the finish."
Markus Huber 2019 Ried Alte Setzen Grüner Veltliner (Traisental),Markus Huber,White,Ried Alte Setzen,Grüner Veltliner,"Traisental, Austria",14%,$35,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A streak of bright lemon zest accompanies the ripe, green conference pear note on the nose. The palate then adds slightly bitter but completely pleasant citrus pithiness that seems to evolve into yeasty, salty, savory pepperiness without ever leaving that lemon note behind. This is slender but intense and comes with a wonderfully savory finish."
Brezza 2012 Vigna Santa Rosalia  (Nebbiolo d'Alba),Brezza,Red,Vigna Santa Rosalia,Nebbiolo,"Nebbiolo d'Alba, Piedmont, Italy",13.5%,$32,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas suggest crushed blue flower, tilled soil, spice and perfumed berries.

Les Vins Bréban 2015 Château Castel des Maures Cuvée Jeanne Rosé (Côtes de Provence),Les Vins Bréban,Rose,Château Castel des Maures Cuvée Jeanne,Rosé,"Côtes de Provence, Provence, France",12.5%,$15,87,Roger Voss,"From a small vineyard near the coast at Hyères, this wine has the freshest red-berry fruits and lively, bright acidity.

Iijima,"Whiffs of tar and charred wood lend a smoky tone to plump black cherry and cassis flavors in this producer's “tradition” or standard-label bottling. A blend of 70% Grenache, 15% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre vinified partially in foudre, it balances a richness of sunny black fruit against savory nuances of leather, earth and fur. Soft in tannins, it's welcoming young but should improve through 2028."
Peake Ranch 2015 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),Peake Ranch,White,,Chardonnay,"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$40,89,Matt Kettmann,"The nose on this bottling is extremely subtle, with hints of stone fruit and citrus. The palate is extremely crisp and clean, with Asian pear, lime peel and hints of oak smoke. The focus is tightly wound texture more than overt flavors."
Rafael Cambra 2013 El Bon Homme Red (Valencia),Rafael Cambra,Red,El Bon Homme,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Valencia, Levante, Spain",13.5%,$20,87,Michael Schachner,"Scratchy cherry and raspberry aromas are lightly herbal.

Carmelo Patti 2005 Malbec (Mendoza),Carmelo Patti,Red,,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$30,87,Michael Schachner,"Jammy strawberry aromas are alluring but light, which suggests more of an Old World style compared to most of the beefy, brawny Malbecs out there today. The palate is crisp and agile, with light-framed raspberry flavors. More elegant than hefty, but also a little hollow on the midpalate and finish."
E. Guigal 2013 Red (Côtes du Rhône),E. Guigal,Red,,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Côtes du Rhône, Rhône Valley, France",14%,$19,89,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"In this wine, almost equal proportions of Grenache and Syrah yield a steady balance between plush, easy black fruit and darker notes of peppery herb and granite. Fleshy and full bodied yet bright with acidity, it's an appealing wine marked by delicate touches of dark chocolate, bramble and sweet spice."
Talbott 2005 Kali Hart Vineyard Pinot Noir (Monterey County),Talbott,Red,Kali Hart Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$20,83,,"Smells distinctly Porty, with caramelized fruit scents, and tastes sharp and minty, with wintergreen and bitter cherryskin flavors.

Iijima,"Crisp white pear and grapefruit tones dazzle from nose to finish in this pert, pristine blend of Grenache Blanc, Clairette, Bourboulenc and Roussanne. Despite being vinified and aged in 50% new French oak, it's a remarkably zippy sip marked by delicate traces of hazelnut and spice on the finish. Lovely now but should hold through 2025."
Le Bonheur 2004 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),Le Bonheur,White,,Chardonnay,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",13%,$13,84,Susan Kostrzewa,"Fresh, while maintaining a spicy, oaky character, this is an everyday sip that will pair well with creamy, opulent dishes and fresh seafood. On the palate, it's round and subtle with good spice but has a nice lively feel."
Marqués de la Concordia 2014 Federico Paternina Reserva  (Rioja),Marqués de la Concordia,Red,Federico Paternina Reserva,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$19,89,Michael Schachner,"Up-front aromas of cedary oak, vanilla and spice provide framing for riper berry scents. A full palate with piping acidity is cut by creamy oak, while this tastes of red plum, currant, tobacco, savory spices and vanilla. Although a bit ripe and soupy in structure, this is a classic-style Rioja to drink now."
Erste Neue 2017 Puntay Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),Erste Neue,White,Puntay,"Pinot Bianco, Pinot Blanc","Alto Adige, Northeastern Italy, Italy",14%,$30,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"This has a shy nose that eventually reveals subdued aromas of mature orchard fruit.

It's simply a satisfying mouthful of fruit and wood."
Harris 2003 Jake's Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Harris,Red,Jake's Creek Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15.1%,$75,93,,"I preferred this to Harris's more expensive Treva's Cab because it's not as tannic, offering more immediate pleasure in an opulent, classy way. Soft and charming, yet with an intense structure, the wine is beautiful in blackberry, cherry, anise, green olive and vanilla oak flavors that finish complex and dry. Best now through 2010 for its lush fruit."
Chalone Vineyard 2005 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),Chalone Vineyard,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",13.9%,$14,84,,"Everyday Pinot, a one-dimensional wine with pleasant cherry, raspberry and cocoa flavors finished with a touch of smoky oak.

Giacomo Ascheri 2001 Sorano Coste & Bricco  (Barolo),Giacomo Ascheri,Red,Sorano Coste & Bricco,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$60,89,,"Be careful when you look for thense wines, the labels at Aschieri are a little confusing;  a small white strip label at thumb level distinguishes the Sorano ordinaire from the special Costa Bricco. The wine, itself, is thick and quite poerful, with very ripe dark fruit, roses and earth flavors. It is beginning to show its age, and did not seem quite as fresh as the Sorano, but it proved to be more intense and extracted."
Duckhorn 2003 Merlot (Howell Mountain),Duckhorn,Red,,Merlot,"Howell Mountain, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$70,94,,"Those notorious mountain tannins have largely melted, making the wine drinkable now, although it will hold for a decade with proper cellaring. Lush and velvety, with a drop of Cabernet Franc, this is voluptuous in cherries, black currants and fine, toasty oak."
Lucienne 2015 Smith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Lucienne,Red,Smith Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$50,94,Matt Kettmann,"There are elegant aromas of potpourri, purple flowers, rose hips, fennel, wild mint, blackberries and plums on the nose of this top-end bottling from the Hahn family.

But because it is 2005, the natural exuberance of the fruit is also there, lively red berries under the dry structure. It needs some aging, but already the richness is there, along with a smoky aftertaste."

It's the most closed of their dry Rieslings, requiring a hearty decant to show its stuffing: tart apple and citrus fruit, with streaks of vanilla and spice. Or age it a few years longer to allow more nuances to emerge."

The Maple Vineyard challenges winemakers to harness the potent alcohol levels almost always found in the wines. This bottling has major alcohol, but it somehow works. The wine is big and warming, but not hot, and contains no overripeness. It's a spicy, fruity, full-bodied wine that will pair magnificently with barbecue."

The streamlined palate comes in with bundled citrus notes. The tart flesh of tangerine and the zest of lemon are softened and enriched with orange oil and ample concentration. This is pure and racy, linear and bold. There is something salty and energetic, something incredibly fresh and vibrant at the core. The palate and finish are absolutely dry, the echo is long and clean. Blastingly fresh right now, sure to evolve. Drink 2019–2037."
Valdetan 2001 Tinto Red (Cigales),Valdetan,Red,Tinto,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Cigales, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,,87,Michael Schachner,"Young and boisterous, but nice and tasty. The color is violet, while the aromas are unchained and saturated. Flavors of black plum, ripe grapes and rubber make for uncommon richness, while the finish is sizable and real.

Iijima,"While smoky and mineral on the nose, the palate of this semidry Rieslaner, a cross between Riesling and Sylvaner, is boldly fruity. Fresh tangerine and berry notes are a bit candied on the palate but balanced neatly by a racy streak of acidity. This light-bodied sip finishes with sweetness."

Graham's,Port/Sherry,Vintage,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,,96,Roger Voss,"Deliciously sweet and perfumed, its powerful plum fruit flavors make this wine already accessible.

It's almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, with citrusy acids framing flavors of limes, pineapples and green apples that have a minerally edge. New French oak adds just the right touch of richness."
Château la Cabanne 2010 Barrel sample  (Pomerol),Château la Cabanne,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pomerol, Bordeaux, France",,,94,Roger Voss,"93-95 Complex wine, its ripe Merlot character structured with tannins, a solid dark core, ripely balanced and intense.

Sullivan,"On first pour it is the oak —25% new French—that leads with prominent notes of vanilla, but as it opens up these recede to reveal baked apple, butterscotch and pear. It's creamy and almost unctuous in feel with the sweetness of the fruit giving the suggestion of residual sugar."
Edgebaston 2007 Finlayson Family Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),Edgebaston,Red,Finlayson Family Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",14%,$23,88,Susan Kostrzewa,"Herbs, pepper, cedar and smoked sausage on the nose and palate give this Cabernet a rustic, inviting character. Flavors are delivered in a mouthfilling, layered way on the tongue, with lots of spice and cedar in the finish. Good minerality and balance mean it's not overpowering for food."

McCrea Cellars 2008 Amerique Syrah (Yakima Valley),McCrea Cellars,Red,Amerique,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.8%,$28,91,Paul Gregutt,"This is an elegant Syrah, blended with 18% Mourvèdre and topped with a splash of Grenache. Good phenolic ripeness along with substantial sugars lead into flavors that have melded nicely. Berry, truffle, chocolate, leather, pepper and coffee are all in the mix, and the mid-palate is delicious. Only a fairly quick fade keeps the score from climbing even higher."
Eraldo Viberti 2016  Barolo,Eraldo Viberti,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$50,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of espresso, cedar and tobacco emerge from the glass. The dense palate offers prune, licorice and roasted coffee alongside assertive tannins that create a rather astringent finish."

The palate is plump and rich, with a vice-like grip of savory, woody, tight-grained tannins, lifted acidity and crunchy red fruit. Still finding its feet, this this could use a few more years in bottle. Drink 2020–2030."
Prager 2013 Aria White Port (Napa Valley),Prager,Port/Sherry,Aria White,"Port, Port Blend","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",19.5%,$50,92,Virginie Boone,"Bottled in 2017, this dessert wine is made entirely from Chardonnay and dazzles in lithe layers of apple, pear and melon.

The residual sugar is listed as 2%, but rather than sweetness, the wine carries a sour lemon snap and a palate of tart citrus and orange soda flavors."
Altocedro 2014 Año Cero Malbec (La Consulta),Altocedro,Red,Año Cero,Malbec,"La Consulta, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.5%,$19,88,Michael Schachner,"Forced woody aromas and flavors are a persistent theme on this Uco Valley Malbec, which smells a bit horsey and stewed. Dense black-fruit flavors are roasted and peppery, while wood and related resin notes rise up on the back palate. Rustic power and fiery heat are loud elements on a fully oaked finish."
Royal Tokaji 2007 Furmint (Hungary),Royal Tokaji,White,,"Furmint, Other White","Hungary, Hungary",14.5%,$17,87,Susan Kostrzewa,"This lively, dry white from Hungary starts with aromas of apple, oaky spice and citrus, leading in to balanced fruit flavors with a toasty vanilla edge.

A Donkey and Goat 2007 Syrah (Mendocino),A Donkey and Goat,Red,,,"Mendocino, Mendocino County, California, US",14.1%,$20,89,,"A very nice Syrah that shows plenty of upscale character. While it's not as complex as the winery's vineyard-designated Syrahs, it shows a rich tannin structure and ripe blackberry, anise, chocolate and pepper flavors.

This is 60% Merlot and 40% Malbec; it feels grabby, while toasty, heavily oaked flavors of clove and bitter chocolate smother the wine's fruit before turning charred and roasted on the finish."

Kriter NV Blanc de Blancs Brut  (France),Kriter,Sparkling,Blanc de Blancs Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","France, France Other, France",11.5%,$9,85,Joe Czerwinski,"This is a blend of white grapes from various parts of France, and thus ineligible for any appellation contrôlée. Yes, the bead is a little larger than it might be if the wine's second fermentation had been in the bottle, but the costs associated with that would price it well out of the value range. Still, it does ferment for seven months before aging on the lees for an additional nine, acquiring toasty, autolytic notes to complement its ripe fruit flavors. It's a soft, approachable bubbly ideal for large holiday crowds."

This blend of Merlot and Cab Franc is choppy and fresh in feel, with jumpy acids propping up red currant, plum and raspberry flavors that come with oak-based vanilla.

The palate is rich and unctuous but fresh with the lemon peel, herb and clear honey notes that were already present on the nose. The balance between luscious and tart is on a knife's edge and all the more thrilling for it. The flavors last and last—not in sweetness but in utter, gloried freshness. Drink 2016–2040."

Mayacamas 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Mount Veeder),Mayacamas,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Mount Veeder, Napa, California, US",13.5%,$25,87,,"Tastes like the grapes really struggled to get ripe in this chilly vintage.

With time in glass, fresh and ripe pineapple tantalizes. The palate is concentrated and has a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge, stony definition and a core of freshness. The undeniably ripe fruit is still tightly corseted and will need cellaring to express itself. Drinks as of 2018."
Lavender Ridge 2002 Syrah (Sierra Foothills),Lavender Ridge,Red,,,"Sierra Foothills, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.4%,$28,85,,Jammy red-berry fruit gives this wine the scent of raspberry confiture.

A power-packed, evocative Bordeaux blend, it features tightly knit and layered black fruits, augmented with subtle barrel flavors, earth and herb. The balance is beautifully managed; firm acids balance out the still-chewy tannins, and hints of pepper and herb add just the right spicy highlights."

Franz Künstler 2001 Hochheimer Holle Spätlese Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),Franz Künstler,White,Hochheimer Holle Spätlese Trocken,Riesling,"Rheingau, Germany",,$40,84,Roger Voss,These Trocken Spätlese with their high (12.5%). alcohol are strange. They lack the grace of the lighter wines. But they pack punch and power which lies oddly with freshly ripe grapes. Peppery characters are uncomfortable to drink.

Hawkers Gate 2000 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Hawkers Gate,Red,,,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",13.5%,$21,85,,"The nose offers stewy, jammy fruit and pickling-spice aromas.

The flavors resonate through pure fruit, stone and chocolate, yet maintain a feminine, elegant style.

It's a joyful wine, saturated with beautiful fruit, pure and deeply satisfying."
Dievole 2015 Le Due Arbie  (Chianti Superiore),Dievole,Red,Le Due Arbie,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Superiore, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$18,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made from 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, this informal red opens with subtle baking spice and cassis aromas.

Pata Negra 2011 Gran Selección  (Rioja),Pata Negra,Red,Gran Selección,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$15,86,Michael Schachner,"Cherry, raspberry and spicy oak aromas open this chunky, standard Rioja.

A racy, rubbery and pinching palate holds tart plum and currant flavors. This wine is constrained as a whole, but juicy."
Thorn Clarke 2017 William Randell Shiraz (Barossa),Thorn Clarke,Red,William Randell,,"Barossa, South Australia, Australia",15.5%,$58,90,Christina Pickard,"Less jammy than the previous vintage, this is still a beast of a wine, but one with some layers and nuance. The nose is a dense combo of charred oak, golden beet, fleshy plum, licorice root, coffee bean and earthy spices. Muscular tannins on the palate are chalky, while the fruit feels satiny. The oak is in the foreground now but should integrate with time. Don't touch this anytime soon. Drink 2023–2035."

Cinnamon, clove and cedar notes waft up from the glass, with rich blueberry, blackberry and espresso flavors that coat the palate. Grown at 2,640 feet in a vineyard strewn with sharp, black obsidian rocks, the wine is packed with minute threads of tannin that add good grip to the texture without being at all drying. Best after 2023."
Musella 2008 Vigne Nuove  (Valpolicella Superiore),Musella,Red,Vigne Nuove,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara, Italian Red","Valpolicella Superiore, Veneto, Italy",13%,$12,83,,"Aged in traditional large oak casks, this easy wine offers bright berry tones with touches of toasted almond and spice.

Hinman 2014 Pinot Gris (Oregon),Hinman,White,,,"Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",13%,$14,83,Paul Gregutt,"This wine has a perceptible tawny tone despite its youth, and the scents also seem to suggest that the wine is slightly oxidized. Whiffs of sherry and apple cider lead into a soft, flat, rather dull palate of nondescript fruit."

With no dosage, it is crisp, tight and mineral. The high proportion of Pinot Meunier in the blend brings out the the flavors of white fruits and the crisp texture. The bottling is still young and will be better from 2017."
Signaterra Benziger 2009 Shone Farm Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),Signaterra Benziger,White,Shone Farm Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$26,85,,"Dry and crisp, with pure citrus flavors of Meyer lemon, lime and pink grapefruit.

There are scent and flavor accents of tanned leather and savory herbs, and the wine is built for staying power.

Midnight 2006 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Paso Robles),Midnight,White,Estate Reserve,Chardonnay,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.2%,$28,80,,"Soft and gluey, with sweet, jammy flavors of pineapples and butterscotch. Tastes like cough drops."
Marqués de la Concordia 2007 Federico Paternina Gran Reserva  (Rioja),Marqués de la Concordia,Red,Federico Paternina Gran Reserva,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$25,88,Michael Schachner,"Plum and raspberry aromas are fresh and jammy, with a mushroom note. On the palate, this aged Rioja is wide but with raw tannins that hammer. Spicy but drawing red-fruit flavors are peppery and lean on a finish that turns tart as it winds down."
Genoa 2015 Ketch Tuscan-style Red (Red Mountain),Genoa,Red,Ketch Tuscan-style,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",15.5%,$42,87,Sean P. Sullivan,"Syrah comprises 63% of this wine, with the balance Merlot (25%) and Sangiovese. Vanilla extract, baking spice, green wood and cherry aromas lead to ripe, full-bodied black fruit flavors. The tannins give a dry squeeze. A warm finish caps it off."
Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Beaune du Château Premier Cru  (Beaune),Bouchard Père & Fils,White,Beaune du Château Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Beaune, Burgundy, France",13%,,91,Roger Voss,"One of Bouchard's signature wines, this is a selection of fruit from different Beaune vineyards in the company's domaine. It is big, ripe and soft, balancing these elements with rounded cantaloupe fruit and spice. The toast is a major factor at present, and the wine would benefit from 2 years aging."
Prunotto 2003 Fiulot  (Barbera d'Asti),Prunotto,Red,Fiulot,Barbera,"Barbera d'Asti, Piedmont, Italy",,$13,88,Roger Voss,"A warm, generous wine with good, meaty, intense fruit, from the Piedmont region of Italy. It shows the accessibility of Barbera, but also its potential richness and concentration. Layers of soft wood and herbs add complexity. In the local dialect, “fiulot” means “young man,” and Prunotto, which is owned by Antinori, has chosen the name for the most youthful style of wine in its range."
Sherwood House Vineyards 2016 Oregon Road White Merlot Rosé (North Fork of Long Island),Sherwood House Vineyards,Rose,Oregon Road White Merlot,Rosé,"North Fork of Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",13.3%,$18,87,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whiffs of watermelon and spring blossoms abound on the nose of this dry Merlot, vinified as a white wine. Crisp yellow-cherry and citrus flavors are a bit more delicate in concentration on the palate but its vibrant acidity is refreshing."
Tenuta Le Querce 2000 Rosso di Costanza  (Aglianico del Vulture),Tenuta Le Querce,Red,Rosso di Costanza,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Aglianico del Vulture, Southern Italy, Italy",13.5%,$40,90,Michael Schachner,"Stylish but bold. The nose is bruising but lively, with pepper, plum and overall punch. In the mouth, black cherry and raspberry fruit is both snappy and rich. A wine with personality. And it's not fading."
Burgáns 2010 Albariño (Rías Baixas),Burgáns,White,,Albariño,"Rías Baixas, Galicia, Spain",13%,$15,90,Michael Schachner,"Simply delicious white wine with lip-smacking freshness, bright peach and apple flavors, and clarity from front to back. It's a little leesy but a lot more crisp and oceanic, with a well-cut body and mild citrus undertones throughout."
Domaine les Goubert 2000 Cuvée Florence  (Gigondas),Domaine les Goubert,Red,Cuvée Florence,"Grenache-Syrah, Rhône-style Red Blend","Gigondas, Rhône Valley, France",13.5%,$50,88,Joe Czerwinski,"This prestige cuvée gets the full barrel treatment, and it shows in its aromas of smoke, cedar, tobacco and molasses. Some plum and earth flavors do poke through on the palate, giving us hope that its evolution will put it into a more balanced place. Hold 4–5 years."
D'Arenberg 2002 The Olive Grove Chardonnay (McLaren Vale),D'Arenberg,White,The Olive Grove,Chardonnay,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",14%,$15,85,,"Tastes and smells quite tropical, with pineapple and melon at the fore. The nose shows some butter, but on the palate that plump yellowness is more like honey. Finishes a little tart, but it's still a juicy wine."
Big Basin 2011 Rattlesnake Rock Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains),Big Basin,Red,Rattlesnake Rock,,"Santa Cruz Mountains, Central Coast, California, US",13.2%,$55,93,Matt Kettmann,"Prevalent black pepper scents swirl alluringly with leather, air-dried meats, tea and blackberry fruit on the nose. It's light, vibrant and peppery on the palate as well, making it a refreshing wine that also delivers a hefty, satisfying flavor profile."
De Martino 2005 Legado Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley),De Martino,Red,Legado Reserva,Carmenère,"Maipo Valley, Chile",14.5%,$15,87,Michael Schachner,"Standard but crisp red-fruit aromas are the greeting, while the main course is centered around bright raspberry and cherry flavors. It shows a touch of varietal character, meaning it's spicy and a touch saucy. But overall it registers well, with medium depth and length."
Graveyard 2015 Scream Red (Paso Robles),Graveyard,Red,Scream,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$36,87,Matt Kettmann,"Black-currant jam, crushed slate and black plum show on the nose of this bottling, which features a rendition of the famed Edvard Munch painting on the label. Candied cherry and blackberry meet with a roasted wood flavor on the palate."
Clusserath-Weiler 2005 Trittenheimer Apotheke Spätlese* Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),Clusserath-Weiler,White,Trittenheimer Apotheke Spätlese*,Riesling,"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, Germany",9%,$31,89,Joe Czerwinski,"Sweet and full-bodied, this is packed with apple, pear and quince flavors. Initial leesy notes slowly blow off, so decant prior to serving, or age 5–7 years. This is lush rather than classically racy, but still very enjoyable."
J.P. Chenet 2020 Original Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),J.P. Chenet,White,Original,Sauvignon Blanc,"Vin de France, France Other, France",11%,$13,86,Fiona Adams,"A shy nose on this wine only lightly suggests citrus and river rocks. The palate is pleasantly lemony, light in concentration but bolstered by zesty acidity with a clean finish. Pair this wine with oysters."
Tenuta Cocci Grifoni 2003 Le Torri  (Rosso Piceno Superiore),Tenuta Cocci Grifoni,Red,Le Torri,Sangiovese,"Rosso Piceno Superiore, Central Italy, Italy",13%,$13,88,Michael Schachner,"Young and spunky, but very good when placed under the microscope. The nose is forward and fruity, with animal cracker and juniper as secondary aromas. The mouthfeel is full and ripe, and that's backed by tasty berry flavors. With tannin and chocolate on the finish you can safely say that's it's a full package in its price range. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd."
El Toqui 2005 Reserva Carmenère (Rapel Valley),El Toqui,Red,Reserva,Carmenère,"Rapel Valley, Chile",13.5%,$14,84,Michael Schachner,"Lively on the nose, with a strong whiff of Pine Sol but also some mulchy leaves. The palate is chunky and solid in terms of feel, with short berry and plum flavors mixed with green, mossy, drying tannins. A bit funky but not out of the realm of what's normal for Carmenère."
Black Pearl 2008 Oro Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Paarl),Black Pearl,Red,Oro,,"Paarl, South Africa",15%,$18,89,Lauren Buzzeo,"The '08 Oro is Cab dominant while the '07 favored Shiraz, a difference that seems to be an improvement. Rich and concentrated with lovely dark plum, cassis and black raspberry components coupled with accents of tree bark, sweet spice and soft cigar tobacco. Fresh and lush all at once; easy to drink now or can hold for a year or two."
Lamoreaux Landing 2009 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Lamoreaux Landing,White,Semi-Dry,Riesling,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",11.5%,$13,87,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Bitter lime peel and an elegant steeliness give structure to the sweet, fresh apples that dominate this off-dry style Riesling. Bright lemon-lime acidity leads to a mouthwatering pucker on the finish."
Carl Loewen 2004 Leiwener Klostergarten Kabinett Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),Carl Loewen,White,Leiwener Klostergarten Kabinett,Riesling,"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, Germany",8%,$19,91,Joe Czerwinski,"In what could prove to be a breakout vintage for Loewen, the Leiwener Klostergarten Kabinett is a star. Heavily mineral on the nose, with some characteristic leesy notes, it then bursts on the palate with concentrated flavors of apple, pear and lime, all underscored by cool minerality. Finishes long and citrusy. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines."
Lula 2018 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Lula,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14%,$45,93,Jim Gordon,"A savory, leafy expression lends extra interest and complexity to this well-balanced, trim but flavorful wine. A full body and light, integrated tannins support generous black-cherry and strawberry flavors."
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.5%,$26,84,,"Made in a sugary style that gives it popular appeal. The flavors are of apricot, orange-lime jam, vanilla and white currants, brightened with crisp acidity."
Force Majeure 2011 Collaboration Series V Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),Force Majeure,Red,Collaboration Series V Ciel du Cheval Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",15.3%,$80,93,Paul Gregutt,"Chris Gorman is the winemaker for this pure, old vine Cabernet Sauvignon. Despite the high alcohol and the use of 100% new French oak, most of the old vine nuances are still there—a wild mix of heather and herb with berry and grain scents that weave together in the mouth. Brambly and tart, with strawberry and cherry fruit, it's a compelling wine that keeps you on your toes."
Broke Ass 2009 Red Malbec-Syrah (Mendoza),Broke Ass,Red,Red,,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$4,84,Michael Schachner,"Crimson in color but also translucent, with a candied, slightly green nose. Overall this is a simple quaffer with no excess weight and reasonably good flavors of berry and plum. Bland on the finish, but for $4 who's caring about finish?"
Roquevale 2017 Redondo Red (Alentejo),Roquevale,Red,Redondo,Portuguese Red,"Alentejo, Portugal",13.5%,$10,87,Roger Voss,"This ripe, dense wine is rich with red berry fruits that are laced with acidity and spice. Its soft tannins and crisp edge are full of fruit that is layered with an attractive, juicy aftertaste. Drink now."
Thomas Fogarty 2017 Damiana Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),Thomas Fogarty,White,Damiana Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Santa Cruz Mountains, Central Coast, California, US",13.4%,$62,93,Matt Kettmann,"Soft, creamy aromas of nectarine and apricot meet with warmer touches of butterscotch and crème fraîche on the light yet lush nose of this bottling. There's a chalky, grippy texture to the sip, where a toasty backdrop upholds flavors of baked lemon, macadamia nut and sea salt."
Produttori di Manduria 2015 Elegia Riserva  (Primitivo di Manduria),Produttori di Manduria,Red,Elegia Riserva,"Primitivo, Zinfandel","Primitivo di Manduria, Southern Italy, Italy",15%,$33,90,Alexander Peartree,"Aromas of baked cherry and blackberry meld with dried hay, anise and orange on the nose. The medium-bodied palate is all about jammy fruit, with accents of spice, orange and earth that add complexity. Bright acidity and drying tannins push through to tighten up the close."
Viña Requingua 2007 Toro de Piedra Reserva Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley),Viña Requingua,Red,Toro de Piedra Reserva,,"Curicó Valley, Chile",14%,$15,85,Michael Schachner,"Fairly generic on the nose, with a floral accent. The mouthfeel is tannic and hard, thus the name Toro de Piedra (Bull of Stone) is appropriate. Rubbery, dark and baked flavors of blackberry and chocolate give this a masculine personality, and the finish is pure nails. This may be one to hold for another year; maybe the tannins will soften."
Kendall-Jackson 2002 Vintner's Reserve Zinfandel (California),Kendall-Jackson,Red,Vintner's Reserve,Zinfandel,"California, California Other, California, US",14.5%,$12,86,,"Made in a popular style, this jammy wine has cherry, blackberry and spiced rum flavors that are ripe and pure, with a pleasantly tannic texture. Easy to like."
Willful 2018 Seven Hills Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),Willful,Red,Seven Hills Vineyard,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Walla Walla Valley (OR), Oregon Other, Oregon, US",14.4%,$32,91,Sean P. Sullivan,"Half Cabernet Sauvignon, half Merlot and hailing from one of the valley's top sites, this old-vine wine was fermented whole cluster. The aromas intrigue in notes of black tea, flower, raspberry, soil, date and cassis. There's pleasing depth and freshness to the flavors, with the oak pulled way back."
2820 Wine Co. 2002 Merlot (Napa Valley),2820 Wine Co.,Red,,Merlot,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$22,85,,"Soft, easy and flavorful, this Merlot has fruity tastes of cherries, black raspberries and latte dusted with cocoa and cinnamon. Drink now."

Mumm,Sparkling,RSRV Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut,Chardonnay,"Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$85,93,Roger Voss,"Bright acidity and tense minerality come together in this taut, beautifully structured wine, bringing out flavors of nuts and citrus. Drink now."

Sullivan,"Aromas of leafy herbs, kirsch, black cherry jam and spice lead to quite ripe fruit flavors. It's a strange mixture of overripe and underripe elements, wanting a bit more structure to support the ripe fruit."
Domaine Sigalas 2004 VinSanto White (Santorini),Domaine Sigalas,Dessert,VinSanto,White Blend,"Santorini, Greece",9%,$49,91,Susan Kostrzewa,"Exotic aromas of coconut, honey and spice start this unique wine from Sigalas. On the palate, waves of lemon, coconut and vanilla are balanced by acidity and spice. Delicious, and unfolding on the tongue, it has its own distinct personality, with a faraway flair."
Château Certan de May de Certan 2009 Barrel sample  (Pomerol),Château Certan de May de Certan,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pomerol, Bordeaux, France",,,95,Roger Voss,"94-96 Barrel sample. Wonderful concentration here, the wine has the most powerful wood spice, ripe and mineral tannins. It is impressive in every way, showing the total richness of the vintage."
Wine Spots 2016 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Wine Spots,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$25,89,Virginie Boone,"Dense, rich and smoky in cherry, bark and clove, this wine is full bodied and inviting, with a big streak of forest floor that's unrelentingly earthy."
Domaine Albert Mann 2010 Furstentum Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),Domaine Albert Mann,White,Furstentum Grand Cru,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",14%,$34,93,Roger Voss,"Rich, full bodied and medium dry, it is powered by ripe fruits, lychees and pomegranates. A spicy undertow brings along some acidity to this concentrated wine. Drink from 2016."
Allegrini 2007 Palazzo della Torre Red (Veronese),Allegrini,Red,Palazzo della Torre,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Veronese, Veneto, Italy",13.5%,$20,88,,"A blend of grapes including traditional Corvina and Rondinella undergoes air-drying for extra-rich concentration and intensity. That, with careful oak aging, has shaped a richly textured, dense wine that would pair with game meat or bean soup with smoked bacon. It shows raw, slightly chewy tannins on the close."
Georges Duboeuf 2007 Cuvée Elevé en Fût de Chêne  (Moulin-à-Vent),Georges Duboeuf,Red,Cuvée Elevé en Fût de Chêne,Gamay,"Moulin-à-Vent, Beaujolais, France",13%,VivinoGary's Wine,86,Roger Voss,"Fresh, gushing strawberry and red cherry fruit. There is just a side order of tannin, and a hint of wood, but this wine just shows very fresh fruit and sweet and sour acidity. Drink now."
Villa Franciacorta 2013 Emozione Brut  (Franciacorta),Villa Franciacorta,Sparkling,Emozione Brut,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Franciacorta, Lombardy, Italy",12.5%,,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"White wild flower, ripe orchard fruit, toasted nut and bread crust aromas lift out of the glass. The vibrant juicy palate tastes of Golden Delicious apple, candied tangerine zest and crystallized ginger zest alongside bright acidity and a lively perlage."
Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2012 Blanchot Grand Cru  (Chablis),Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils,White,Blanchot Grand Cru,Chardonnay,"Chablis, Burgundy, France",13%,$85,94,Roger Voss,"With its perfect south-facing exposure, the Blanchot Grand Cru produces a warm wine. It is opulent, a power of ripe Chardonnay and spicy wood. Combining rich yellow plums, citrus and apricot, topped with wood, this is a structured wine to age. Drink from 2018."
Maryhill 2015 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Maryhill,Red,,,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.8%,$36,85,Sean P. Sullivan,"This is straight-down-the-fairway Syrah, with berry, cocoa and spice aromas and flavors. It's not very complex but enjoyable all the same."
Otis Kenyon 2007 Carmenère (Horse Heaven Hills),Otis Kenyon,Red,,Carmenère,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$36,90,Paul Gregutt,"This almost pure Carmenère (there is a little Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend also) sneaks up on you. At first herbal and green, it fills in with a few hours of breathing time, lengthens and shows unsuspected complexity. Cranberry, a whiff of smoke, a bite of pepper, and fresh, not dried herbs, nicely blended into a seamless, satisfying whole."
Three Rivers 2007 Champoux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),Three Rivers,Red,Champoux Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$50,89,Paul Gregutt,"The Champoux vineyard's classic black cherry fruit is here driven deep into a seam of what can only be described as dense rock. Astringent and dark, with a dusty, chalky character, this seam of graphite continues on through the finish. Reminiscent of some mediumripe Bordeaux, this should be drunk with a thick, juicy steak."
Château Simon 2015  Sauternes,Château Simon,Dessert,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Sauternes, Bordeaux, France",14%,$35,91,Roger Voss,"Already developing well, this rich wine is balanced by acidity. It offers spice, generous apricot and wildflower-honey flavors and a core of botrytis. This wine from Anne-Laure Dufour is still young and will develop further. Drink from 2021."
Torre Mascoli 2001 Niró Red (Murgia),Torre Mascoli,Red,Niró,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Murgia, Southern Italy, Italy",13%,$10,83,Michael Schachner,"Nail polish and other sweet, somewhat artificial aromas lead to raspberry flavors. It's a tight, lean wine with more acidity than flesh. A little bit sour but drinkable. Blends Sangiovese, Uva de Troia, Cabernet and Merlot with modest results."
Domaine Charles Baur 2015 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),Domaine Charles Baur,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$17,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,The nose is very shy: a mere hint of earthiness emanates. The slender palate shows very clean fruit of yellow apple residing on a slender lemony palate. This is fresh and sprightly with a dry finish. Drink soon.
Snake and Herring 2014 Dirty Boots Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),Snake and Herring,Red,Dirty Boots,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Margaret River, Western Australia, Australia",14%,$27,91,Christina Pickard,"A typical yet classy example of Margaret River, this wine dishes up notes of dark cherry, currant, tobacco, mocha, eucalyptus and dried green herbs. The medium-bodied palate has soft but chewy tannins, with some apparent oak components and a dark-cherry and green-tinged finish. It's elegant and soft enough to drink now but will age well through 2028."
Eaglepoint Ranch 2006 Syrah (Mendocino County),Eaglepoint Ranch,Red,,,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",14.3%,$20,88,,"Dry, leathery and tannic, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. It has tightly wound flavors of crushed blackberries, black currants, cola, leather and pepper. It's a good mountain wine, but it really needs some time. Give it four or five years."
Michel Rolland Napa Valley 2014 MR Red (Napa Valley),Michel Rolland Napa Valley,Red,MR,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.9%,$175,95,Virginie Boone,"Made in partnership with Alpha Omega Winery's Jean Hoefliger, this famous namesake wine embraces the fullness that is Napa Valley concentration and sunny richness, showing baked plum, cinnamon and generous tannin and oak. The backbone is plush and lush in texture, evolving as it opens in the glass. Enjoy this in good time; should show best 2024–2034."
Apothic 2016 Winemaker's Red (California),Apothic,Red,Winemaker's,"Red Blends, Red Blends","California, California Other, California, US",13.5%,$14,84,Jim Gordon,"A chocolaty sweetness pervades this medium-bodied, smooth-textured and oaky wine. It adds grape jam to the chocolate flavors and has a soft mouthfeel."
Casa Santos Lima 2013 Bona Vita Red (Lisboa),Casa Santos Lima,Red,Bona Vita,Portuguese Red,"Lisboa, Portugal",14%,,86,Roger Voss,"This is a soft, bold and rounded wine. Rich black currant and berry fruits dominate the blend of mainly Portuguese grapes, with a touch of Syrah. The wine is balanced, ripe and full in the mouth. Drink now."
Sonora 1997 Story Vyd Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),Sonora,Red,Story Vyd,Zinfandel,"Shenandoah Valley (CA), Sierra Foothills, California, US",,$19,86,Paul Gregutt,"The flavors are almost moving into late-harvest; raisiny, superripe, hot and tannic. On the plus side is the finish, with sweet, juicy, jammy fruit that is really tasty. From 77-year-old vines."
Barnett 2006 Cyrus Ryan Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Barnett,Red,Cyrus Ryan Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$95,92,,"Made in the modern, cult Napa style, this Cab, from a vineyard north of St. Helena, is tremendously rich, soft and oaky. It strikes you with effusive flavors of ripe black currants, chocolate, anise and cedar, but most impressive is the smooth quality of the tannins. Youthfully brash now, it should gather forces and mellow out after 2010 and beyond."
Peirano 2016 The Heritage Collection Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),Peirano,Red,The Heritage Collection Old Vine,Zinfandel,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",14.8%,$14,90,Jim Gordon,"This full-bodied wine boasts delicious fruit flavors, a dose of spicy oak, good balance and a wonderful sense of polish. Jammy raspberry and strawberry flavors meet hints of smoke, meat and herbs."
Cantina Kurtatsch 2018 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),Cantina Kurtatsch,White,,Pinot Grigio,"Alto Adige, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13.5%,$18,92,Kerin O’Keefe,"Here's a fantastic expression of Pinot Grigio that opens with enticing scents of spring wildflowers, white stone fruit and an inviting whiff of freshly baked bread. Savory and medium bodied, the rounded palate offers ripe green apple, yellow pear and lemon zest alongside a tangy mineral note."
Tinto Rey 2014 Super Tinto Red (Dunnigan Hills),Tinto Rey,Red,Super Tinto,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Dunnigan Hills, Central Valley, California, US",13.9%,$22,90,Jim Gordon,"Deep color, bold fruit aromas and substantial, spicy flavors lend significant power and concentration to this full-bodied wine. It's nearly dry, well structured and balanced, with appealing blackberry, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors."
Graffigna 2010 Centenario Reserve Malbec (San Juan),Graffigna,Red,Centenario Reserve,Malbec,"San Juan, Other, Argentina",13.5%,$13,84,Michael Schachner,"This is superdark and savory smelling, with aromas of cumin, char, roasted blackberry and licorice.

Thörle 2013 Saulheimer Probstey Trocken Silvaner (Rheinhessen),Thörle,White,Saulheimer Probstey Trocken,"Silvaner, Other White","Rheinhessen, Germany",13.5%,$39,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Often herbal and a bit green in nature, Silvaner is a much maligned grape. Yet at Thörle, it seems to blossom into something perfumed and quite fruity, redolent of peaches and fresh pears. Characteristic herb notes are fresh and nuanced, highlighted against brisk citrus and apple flavors and a silken supple mouthfeel."
Maison Pagnotta 2018 Clos Voyens Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Maison Pagnotta,Red,Clos Voyens Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Mercurey, Burgundy, France",13%,,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A note of mocha fills and dominates the nose on this wine. Mocha also characterizes the sonorous palate, which is roasted and mellow at the same time. This roasted note broadens out the cherry fruit on the palate, but this is counteracted by freshness."
Villa Cerna 2014 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Villa Cerna,Red,Riserva,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$35,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of roasted coffee bean, baking spice and a hint of blue flower lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate delivers clove, licorice and red plum alongside close-grained tannins. Drink through 2023."
Clos du Lac 2001 Reserve Blend Zinfandel (Amador County),Clos du Lac,Red,Reserve Blend,Zinfandel,"Amador County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",,$16,87,,"Unmistakably California Zin, with its briary, brambly flood of wild berry and peppery spice flavors that finish dry and tannic. It's not a heavy wine, but has a silky lightness that makes it super-drinkable."
Allan Hancock 2019 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),Allan Hancock,White,,Chardonnay,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$14,88,Matt Kettmann,"Lightly honeyed aromas of pineapple and ripe orange are clean on the nose of this bottling. There's just enough grip to the palate, giving depth to the yellow-pear and tangerine-peel flavors."
Ancient Peaks 2009 Oyster Ridge Red (Paso Robles),Ancient Peaks,Red,Oyster Ridge,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$50,90,,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this is bone dry and full bodied, and it strikes the palate with rustic tannins. It has a complexity that's hard to define, and it will pair well with grilled meats or stews."
Billecart-Salmon 2006 Cuvée Elisabeth Salmon Brut Rosé  (Champagne),Billecart-Salmon,Sparkling,Cuvée Elisabeth Salmon Brut Rosé,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12.5%,VivinoGary's WineTotal Wine,94,Roger Voss,"Produced from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this balances ripe red berry and citrus fruits with more mature spice and vanilla. With this development has come depth, concentration and richness. It is a wine to drink with food, ripe and finishing with crisp, dry acidity."
Domaine Weinbach 2015 Réserve Pinot Blanc (Alsace),Domaine Weinbach,White,Réserve,Pinot Blanc,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$20,90,Anne Krebiehl MW,White summer blossoms and ripe green pears make for a fresh scent. The palate lifts these notions with bright lemon acidity. All is buoyed by some residual carbon dioxide. Drink soon while this is at its aromatic height.
Señorío de Sarria 2005 Viñedo N° 7 Graciano (Navarra),Señorío de Sarria,Red,Viñedo N° 7,"Graciano, Spanish Red","Navarra, Northern Spain, Spain",12.5%,$15,84,Michael Schachner,"Varietal Graciano is something we frequently see, and very rarely does it bowl us over. This wine has jumpy cherry and lemon peel aromas, and the flavors are tight, a touch sour and run toward cherry and red plum. Fruity for certain, but lacking in charm and mouthfeel."
Tenuta San Guido 2018 Le Difese Red (Toscana),Tenuta San Guido,Red,Le Difese,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$40,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of star anise, dark-skinned berry, wild herb and toasted oak form the nose. A blend of 70% Cabernet and 30% Sangiovese, the wine's bright, linear palate offers red currant, prune and a hint of licorice before a coffee-bean finish. Racy acidity and taut close-grained tannins provide the framework and tension."
Karly 2005 Warrior Fires Zinfandel (Amador County),Karly,Red,Warrior Fires,Zinfandel,"Amador County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",15.1%,$26,84,,"The name suggests certain proprietarily named Ports, and it's an apt descriptor for this muscular wine, which has superripe flavors of currants and raisins that veer into an overripe tartness.

There's a pronounced green, herbal note right upfront on the nose of this wine, offering some serious pyrazine character. Green plum and lime leaf lead the aromas and carry through to the medium-weight palate. There's nice body to the mouthfeel, with a subtle creaminess to the midpalate that's then refreshed by bright acidity and a pithy, green-plum skin and lime pith character that floods the finish.

Raymond 2014 District Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Raymond,Red,District Collection,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Stags Leap District, Napa, California, US",15%,$105,93,Virginie Boone,"Richly layered red fruit accents an explosion of firm lengthy tannin, alongside dashes of clove and cinnamon, in this hearty full-bodied red. Robust and concentrated, it shows oaky bursts of vanilla and smoke on the finish."
Discoveries 2011 Moscato (California),Discoveries,Dessert,,"Moscato, Muscat","California, California Other, California, US",10.5%,$10,85,,"You could drink this easy Moscato with fish, chicken, even pork, but it's sweet enough to classify as a dessert wine. It shows flavors of honey, apricots, tangerines and limes."
Benton-Lane 1999 Sunnymount Cuvee Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Benton-Lane,Red,Sunnymount Cuvee,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.3%,$65,91,Paul Gregutt,"Good texture and more flesh than the B-L reserve from the same excellent vintage. This is a beautifully crafted and balanced wine that could pass for a good Gevrey-Chambertin. Flavors of beetroot, herb, leaf, cherry and spicy oak; will certainly improve with further cellar time. Just 100 cases were produced."
Bellussi NV Enrico Extra Dry  (Prosecco),Bellussi,Sparkling,Enrico Extra Dry,"Glera, Italian White","Prosecco, Veneto, Italy",11%,$11,85,,"Touches of sweet peach and honey open the bouquet of this easygoing, well-priced sparkler. Pair this with barbecued shrimp or tempura vegetable appetizers."
Chessman 2010 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),Chessman,White,,Chardonnay,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$14,84,,"This is a distinctly simple Chardonnay. It's marked by pineapple, pear and peach flavors. Will satisfy America's basic Chardonnay craving."
Salomon-Undhof 2016 Ried Kögl Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),Salomon-Undhof,White,Ried Kögl Reserve,Riesling,"Kremstal, Austria",13%,$33,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A touch of yeast still mixes with the clean citrus zest notes on the nose of this wine. On the palate, that leesiness cushions the uncompromising pure lemon freshness. It's concentrated in body and dry, vivid and brisk in its flavors, with a stucture that will keep it delightful until 2030, if not longer. Rejoice in the lip-smacking finish."
Château Belair 2004  Saint-Émilion,Château Belair,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,92,Roger Voss,"A big, ripe, fruity wine, backed up with firm tannins. The structure is impressive, giving smoky flavors and layers of new wood. It is rich and potentially long-lasting. Under the inspired control of Pascal Dalbeck, Belair is fully living up to its classed growth status."
Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2019 Plane Vineyard Pinot Noir Rosé (Finger Lakes),Thirsty Owl Wine Company,Rose,Plane Vineyard Pinot Noir,Rosé,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",11.9%,$20,88,Alexander Peartree,"A pretty shade of salmon pink in the glass, this is a brisk, light-bodied rosé that offers tones of pink grapefruit and white cherry. Bright acidity keeps it fresh, while delicate pepper and cherry-skin tones on the finish lend balance."
Arnaldo Caprai 2008 25 Anni  (Sagrantino di Montefalco),Arnaldo Caprai,Red,25 Anni,"Sagrantino, Italian Red","Sagrantino di Montefalco, Central Italy, Italy",15%,$100,94,Kerin O’Keefe,"This wine deserves its lofty reputation as one of Italy's premier bottlings. It opens with a gorgeous fragrance of berry, leather, truffle and spice. The palate delivers ripe and delicious black cherry, black berry, white pepper and chocolate notes accompanied by firm but refined tannins. This will age beautifully and develop complexity for decades. Drink 2016–2028."
Winderlea 2016 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Winderlea,Red,Winderlea Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13%,$60,92,Paul Gregutt,"Decanting is strongly recommended, as this old-vine, biodynamically farmed wine is shut tight when first opened. Primary fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry gather weight with airing, and the wonderful purity of the wine begins to shine. The lengthy finish is detailed by herb, berry and citrus—subtle, well-integrated flavors that suggest a long life ahead. Drink now through the late 2020s."
Sainte-Croix 2005 La Bergerie Viognier Viognier (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Sainte-Croix,White,La Bergerie Viognier,Viognier,"Vin de Pays d'Oc, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",,,86,Roger Voss,"This is a fresh, lightly perfumed, crisp wine featuring red apple and kiwi fruit flavors. It is poised, elegant, with just a hint of Viognier weight and richness. Not imported."
Camille Giroud 2008 Les Vaucrains  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Camille Giroud,Red,Les Vaucrains,Pinot Noir,"Nuits-St.-Georges, Burgundy, France",,$96,92,Roger Voss,"With smoky aromas and strict tannins, this is initially an austere wine. The fruit remains firm and tight, very powerful, while the final acidity gives a delicious, more juicy finale."
Scott Paul 2011 La Paulée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Scott Paul,Red,La Paulée,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",12.9%,$39,91,Paul Gregutt,"Scott Paul's largest production Pinot Noir is a nicely balanced, silky wine, fermented with wild yeasts and structured for elegance. Raspberry, black cherry, a touch of blood orange and a lick of molasses all contribute."
Pasqua 2004 Villa Borghetti  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),Pasqua,Red,Villa Borghetti,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara, Italian Red","Amarone della Valpolicella Classico, Veneto, Italy",15%,,89,,"This inky Amarone offers dense and inviting aromas of plum, blackberry, freshly crushed black pepper, lead pencil, tar and leather. It delivers most of its intensity to the nose and makes for a food-friendly alternative. Try it with game or pork stuffed with stewed prunes."
Luna Beberide 2010 Art Mencía (Bierzo),Luna Beberide,Red,Art,"Mencía, Spanish Red","Bierzo, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$55,91,Michael Schachner,"Boysenberry, blueberry, graphite and rubbery aromas form a generous bouquet. The mouthfeel is tighter and more structured than the nose, with oaky, baked flavors of blackberry and toast. A dark, toasty, minerally finish has a crisp feel. Drink through 2018."
Banshee 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Banshee,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$25,91,Matt Kettmann,"Pristine aromas of strawberry and herbs are fresh and inviting on the nose of this bottling. There is a fun freshness to the palate, where the cherry tones are enhanced by greener elements of oregano and dill, all wrapped in firm tannins."
Lockwood 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),Lockwood,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Monterey, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$11,83,,"This stainless steel fermented Sauvignon Blanc is kind of thin and weedy, with lemon and lime flavors toned up by citrusy acids. Not bad for this price."
Coeur d'Alene 2005 Opulence Syrah (Washington),Coeur d'Alene,Red,Opulence,,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$40,91,Paul Gregutt,"Opulence is the winery's reserve Syrah, and it is a robust, tooth-staining wine that takes no prisoners. Dense scents suggest a pig roast on a pile of licorice sticks; the aromas are almost visceral. The fruit has been very well handled and the tannins, though full and powerful, have been polished to a satiny sheen. There's a little chalkiness to the finish, perhaps from acidification, but that may well resolve with a little more bottle age."
Planeta 2008 Alastro White (Sicilia),Planeta,White,Alastro,White Blend,"Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",12.5%,$21,88,,"Alastro is a food-friendly blend of Grecanico and Chardonnay. Grecanico adds fresh, floral aromas and the Chardonnay gives the wine its creamy, smooth texture. A percentage of the wine is aged in oak and this process lends aromas of spice and vanilla."
Santa Carolina 2016 Reserva de Familia Malbec (Rapel Valley),Santa Carolina,Red,Reserva de Familia,Malbec,"Rapel Valley, Chile",14.5%,$20,87,Michael Schachner,"A lot of black fruit is on the nose of this Malbec, but also a mild sense of vinegar and volatility. A full, rough palate is braced by hard tannins, while this tastes more oaky, blackened and charred than fruity and defined. Coffee, burnt wood and beefy flavors fill out a grating finish."
Hess Collection 2017 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),Hess Collection,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",14.8%,$20,89,Matt Kettmann,"Rounded aromas of red cherry and mulberry pie meet with star anise and allspice on the nose of this bottling. There is a spicy core to the sip, where gingerbread flavors play against rich cherry and dried strawberry elements."
DFJ Vinhos 2013 Point West White (Lisboa),DFJ Vinhos,White,Point West,Portuguese White,"Lisboa, Portugal",12%,$9,87,Roger Voss,"Alvarinho and Chardonnay are the chosen grapes for this blend. As its name suggests, a salty taste from the ocean spices up the ripe yellow and green plum fruits. It's soft with a fine balance of acidity and a soft honey touch at the end."
San Lorenzo Vini 2014  Trebbiano d'Abruzzo,San Lorenzo Vini,White,,"Trebbiano, Italian White","Trebbiano d'Abruzzo, Central Italy, Italy",12.5%,$12,84,Kerin O’Keefe,"This simple white isn't very expressive, but the palate eventually reveals unripe yellow apple and green pear. It's diluted, with a short finish."
Château d'Ollières 2013 Haut de l'Hermitage Red (Coteaux Varois en Provence),Château d'Ollières,Red,Haut de l'Hermitage,,"Coteaux Varois en Provence, Provence, France",13.5%,$40,92,Roger Voss,"From selected parcels of the Ollières estate, this wine is impressive. It has weight but that is balanced by the acidity and the generous black fruits and acidity. This is certainly a wine that has been well aged, although it would pay to wait another year before drinking. So drink this very fine wine from 2018."
Fratelli Casetta 2005 Riserva  (Barolo),Fratelli Casetta,Red,Riserva,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",,,90,,"This bright Riserva opens with floral, soapy notes of church incense, Spanish cedar, dried orange peel and polished river stone. It's a feminine wine with power and intensity on the close due in part to the immense firmness of the tannins."
K Vintners 2012 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),K Vintners,White,,Viognier,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$25,91,Paul Gregutt,"Now one of three Viogniers produced by Charles Smith, this is from Art den Hoed's Yakima Valley Vineyard, and was barrel fermented in neutral French oak. Clean and pure fruit aromas lead into fresh, natural, tree fruit flavors of peach and apricot. There's a nice kick of citrus in the vibrant acidity."
Markus Altenburger 2014 Jerry &amp; Barry Für Fruchtige Rosé (Weinland Österreich),Markus Altenburger,Rose,Jerry & Barry Für Fruchtige,Rosé,"Weinland Österreich, Austria",10.5%,$10,86,Anne Krebiehl MW,Muddled notes of ripe berry on the nose come into sharper view on the citrus-focused palate. There is a vestige of tannin and pleasant dryness. Drink soon.
Simonnet-Febvre 2015  Saint-Bris,Simonnet-Febvre,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Saint-Bris, Burgundy, France",12.5%,$15,85,Roger Voss,"This wine comes from the only Burgundy region to grow Sauvignon Blanc. It's soft in style, more nutty than herbal, with almond and white fruit flavors. Immediately drinkable and refreshing, it's ready to go now."
Fulldraw 2018 Chopping Block Red (Paso Robles),Fulldraw,Red,Chopping Block,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15.5%,$85,93,Matt Kettmann,"Dense in the glass, this blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre is a lesson in concentration. Aromas of espresso roast, dark fruit, grilled plum and peppery meats lead into a viscous palate with firm tannins. Dark plum, caramel and nutmeg flavors make for a powerful sip."
St. Innocent 2016 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),St. Innocent,White,Freedom Hill Vineyard,Pinot Blanc,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14%,$22,92,Paul Gregutt,"This delicious, sexy wine impresses with its leesy, textural mouthfeel, its mountain spring freshness, it's crisp lemon and grapefruit flavors, and its underlying minerality. One-quarter was fermented in neutral French oak, the rest in stainless steel. A dash of minty wintergreen trails the finish."
Paringa 2009 Shiraz (South Australia),Paringa,Red,,,"South Australia, South Australia, Australia",14.6%,$10,82,Joe Czerwinski,"Very sweet and soft, with mocha notes punctuated by brighter berry flavors that come across as nearly cloying on the finish."
Adorato 2020 Flora Grenache Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),Adorato,White,Flora,"Grenache Blanc, Other White","Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.8%,$29,90,Matt Kettmann,"Tightly woven aromas of melon, plumeria and gardenia are quite floral but balanced on the nose of this bottling. There's a burst of acidity on the palate, leading through green mango and melon bubblegum flavors, with the slightest hint of stone on the finish."
Husch 2018 Dry Gewurztraminer (Anderson Valley),Husch,White,Dry,"Gewürztraminer, Gewürztraminer","Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",13.6%,$15,91,Jim Gordon,"This dry and extremely flavorful wine offers rose petal and prosciutto aromas on the nose, with vivid grapefruit and luscious pear flavors on the palate. A rather full body and a lingering finish add to the experience."
Quinta da Ribeirinha 2013 Vale de Lobos Grande Escolha Red (Tejo),Quinta da Ribeirinha,Red,Vale de Lobos Grande Escolha,Portuguese Red,"Tejo, Portugal",14.5%,$32,92,Roger Voss,"Dense and spicy, this blend includes Touriga Nacional and Alicante Bouschet.The spice is balanced by generous black fruits and acidity that give great structure and density. Drink this wine from early 2018."
Castel Montplaisir 1997  Cahors,Castel Montplaisir,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Cahors, Southwest France, France",12.5%,$11,84,Joe Czerwinski,"Another Cahors from the stable of Alain-Dominque Perrin, this one is the entry-level wine, made to be more accessible than his flagship wine from Château Lagrezette or the luxury cuvée. There's still plenty of toasty oak, but also some raspberry-cherry fruit and green tobacco on the finish."
Golden Kaan 2004 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),Golden Kaan,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Western Cape, South Africa",12.5%,$10,84,Joe Czerwinski,"This crisp Sauvignon doesn't wow with intensity, weight or complexity. But it is a clean, well-crafted wine at an excellent price. Snappy grapefruit flavors are buttressed by hints of honeyed peach and a refreshing finish. Imported by Golden Kaan USA."
Avignonesi 2006 Riserva Grandi Annate  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),Avignonesi,Red,Riserva Grandi Annate,"Prugnolo Gentile, Sangiovese","Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$85,86,,Avignonesi's Riserva Grandi Annate is designed as an icon wine from Tuscany but doesn't quite deliver the goods. The issue has to do with the aromas that recall sweet pumpkin contrasted against intense blue flower or violet.
Amarano 2015 Cardenio  (Greco di Tufo),Amarano,White,Cardenio,"Greco, Italian White","Greco di Tufo, Southern Italy, Italy",14%,,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"The nose is quite shy but eventually reveals subtle whiffs suggesting orchard fruit and crushed rock. The medium-bodied palate is straightforward, offering peach and a saline note accompanied by fresh acidity."
Alto Los Romeros 2015 Chardonnay (Central Valley),Alto Los Romeros,White,,Chardonnay,"Central Valley, Chile",13%,$10,84,Michael Schachner,"Generic from head to toe, this opens with a hint of wood and aromas that suggest cinnamon-spiced applesauce. The palate is plump but flat, while flavors of wood grain and mixed white fruits finish with a vanilla note and then lasting bitterness."
Talent 2014 Nuf Sed Red (Oregon),Talent,Red,Nuf Sed,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",14.2%,$24,90,Paul Gregutt,"This proprietary and undisclosed blend is tart, astringent and aromatic. Notes of raspberry jam, squeezed lemon and coffee syrup take center stage here. It spent 22 months in half new French oak, and it's ready to go."
Oso Libre 2011 Osezno Zinfandel (Paso Robles),Oso Libre,Red,Osezno,Zinfandel,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.8%,$38,85,Matt Kettmann,"Offering a more traditional California Zinfandel style than some of the other 2011s, this takes off with scents of a warm, butter-crusted cherry pie, unfolding on the palate with cranberry jelly. There's a slight herbal character and quite of bit of tannic grip, so expect this one to improve in the years to come."
Prospect 1870 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson),Prospect 1870,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Robertson, South Africa",13%,$30,85,,"The palate is drenched in sweet oak and sugarplums. This is not to say that it is a syrupy quaff: there is also cocoa, toast, dried herbs and a note of eucalyptus that pinches at the finish."
Thörle 2010 Saulheimer Hölle Trocken Spätburgunder (Rheinhessen),Thörle,Red,Saulheimer Hölle Trocken,"Spätburgunder, Pinot Noir","Rheinhessen, Germany",13.5%,$60,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Enticing aromas of blackberry, bramble and wet leaves meld on the nose of this elegant, nuanced Spätburgunder. It's concentrated and juicy, with black cherry flavor, but invigorated by a stream of laser-like acidity that carries through the finish. It ends with a pretty violet accent."
Cascina Val del Prete 2015  Roero,Cascina Val del Prete,White,,"Arneis, Italian White","Roero, Piedmont, Italy",13.5%,$18,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Lovely floral scents of black locust flower, orange blossom and a whiff of aromatic herb float out of the glass. The round but elegantly structured palate offers white peach, white currant, sage and mineral. Soft acidity lifts the creamy flavors."
Meerea Park 2003 Alexander Munro Shiraz (Hunter Valley),Meerea Park,Red,Alexander Munro,,"Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia",14.5%,$39,88,Joe Czerwinski,"A hint of eucalyptus gives this wine's blackberry fruit a slightly medicinal quality, while black-olive notes provide darkness and depth. The tannins impart a texture somewhere between creamy and silky, remaining somewhat firm on the finish. There is considerable sediment, so decant before serving."
Cermeño 2004 Tinto Joven  (Toro),Cermeño,Red,Tinto Joven,"Tinta de Toro, Tempranillo","Toro, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$11,84,Michael Schachner,"Jammy and full of raisin, stewed berries and leather. Calling it ultraripe might be an understatement because it's nearly over the top in its heft, extract and tannin level. A high-production bruiser that has tons of power but very little precision."
Castelnau NV Rosé Brut  (Champagne),Castelnau,Sparkling,Rosé Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12.5%,$60,88,Roger Voss,This fruity Champagne is full of raspberry flavors. The wine's crispness gives a fine lift of acidity and adds a tangy texture at the end. Drink this attractive bottling now.
Tassi 2006 Aquabona Red (Toscana),Tassi,Red,Aquabona,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$40,91,,"Here's an inky colored and deeply concentrated 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot that delivers rock solid structure and intensely dark aromas of blackberry pie, rum cake, plum, prune, clove, leather, cola, and pipe tobacco. You'll need to pair this wine with succulent beef to break up those tight tannins."
Brunelli 2007 Pa' Riondo  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso),Brunelli,Red,Pa' Riondo,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara, Italian Red","Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso, Veneto, Italy",13%,$24,88,,"This is a fragrant and fresh ripasso with pressed rose petal, ripe fruit, spice and aromas of cherry cola. The wine is smooth and soft with a medium to long finish that would work well with pasta dishes. Imported by International Cellars."
Altamana 2015 Single Vineyard Constanza Malbec (Maule Valley),Altamana,Red,Single Vineyard Constanza,Malbec,"Maule Valley, Chile",14%,$46,91,Michael Schachner,"It has taken Alta Vista a few years to get this Maule Valley Malbec right, but this rendition is on the mark. A saturated black color and jammy aromas of blackberry, minerals, licorice root and raisin lead to a fleshy palate that's a touch loose in structure, with tannic backing. Toasty oak, herbal blackberry and gamy flavors are complex, while ripe berry and oak flavors offset a minty green note on the finish. Drink through 2023."
Ste. Chapelle 1998 Special Harvest Riesling (Idaho),Ste. Chapelle,Dessert,Special Harvest,Riesling,"Idaho, Idaho, US",8.2%,$8,85,Joe Czerwinski,Honey and dried apricots provide pretty accents to this late-harvest wine. Sweet but surprisingly light in the mouth. The finish is pleasant but short.
Chateau de Pibarnon 2009 Red (Bandol),Chateau de Pibarnon,Red,,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Bandol, Provence, France",,,90,Roger Voss,"While the wine is a touch gamy, it also has a ripe, fruity character. There is a touch of wood, underlining the acidity and juicy red fruits. The finish brings out the richness of the vintage."
River's Edge 2012 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Elkton Oregon),River's Edge,Red,Barrel Select,Pinot Noir,"Elkton Oregon, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",15%,$23,91,Paul Gregutt,"Offering good value, this high-alcohol barrel selection saw 50% new oak. It's got a whiff of funk, but the main flavors are there—black fruits, coffee grounds, toast, cacao, Dr Pepper—with grainy tannins that finish with generous mocha, caramel and espresso streaks."
Taft Street 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Taft Street,White,,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$22,82,Virginie Boone,This wine offers simple tones of apple and oak on the nose and palate. It is medium in build and straightforward in its appeal.
Leeuwin Estate 2004 Prelude Vineyards Chardonnay (Margaret River),Leeuwin Estate,White,Prelude Vineyards,Chardonnay,"Margaret River, Western Australia, Australia",14.5%,$29,87,,"The Prelude Vineyards Chard typically seems a soft-edged, full wine to me—this year it's even more so. Floral and pear aromas lead to more tropical, toasty flavors of nut and plantain. Acid hounds will want more zing, but this will satisfy most everyone else. Imported by Old Bridge Cellars."
Sonoma Coast Vineyards 2003 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Sonoma Coast Vineyards,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$60,91,,"Made from grapes grown close to the chilly Pacific, this is a wine with bright acidity and elegance. It's got some size, too, but unlike many big, rich Pinots from warmer areas this one toes the line of balance like a pro. The cherry cola, raspberry, tea and gentle spice flavors are satisfying and complex. Best next year and through 2008."
Marqués de Cáceres 2003 Crianza  (Rioja),Marqués de Cáceres,Red,Crianza,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$15,87,Michael Schachner,"Round, clean and a touch leathery, but not penetrating or dense. For a nice, smooth red wine with some plum and cinnamon spice, look no further. This crianza is easygoing, lightly oaked and good throughout."
Benessere 2016 John's Promise Estate Red (St. Helena),Benessere,Red,John's Promise Estate,"Red Blends, Red Blends","St. Helena, Napa, California, US",14.6%,$85,87,Virginie Boone,"An unusual blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Aglianico, this wine has big tannin grip and an intensity of dried cherry, strawberry and mocha. Rose-petal aromas permeate beneath."
Waterstone 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Waterstone,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,VivinoWine.com,82,,"Tastes overripe and hot, with a raisiny, stewed prune edge to the otherwise pleasant blackcurrant and cherry flavors. Too bad, because the tannic structure is very nice. That cooked taste is not going to age out."
Domaine Petitjean 2019  Bourgogne Côtes d’Auxerre,Domaine Petitjean,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Bourgogne Côtes d’Auxerre, Burgundy, France",13%,$16,84,Roger Voss,"An earthy, farmyard-touched wine, this has juicy red fruits alongside acidity. It is tight, needing the acidity to calm down."
Paraduxx 2017 Pintail Red (Napa Valley),Paraduxx,Red,Pintail,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$52,90,Virginie Boone,"Soft and jammy with seasonings of black pepper, dried herb and clove, this is a well-integrated and powerful blend of 68% Zinfandel and 32% Cabernet Sauvignon. Soft tannins grip lightly and without distraction, as toasted oak weighs in."
Budureasca 2018 Clasic Fume White (Dealu Mare),Budureasca,White,Clasic Fume,White Blend,"Dealu Mare, Romania",13.5%,$15,88,Jeff Jenssen,"This semisweet white blend offers aromas of melon, hazelnuts and hickory smoke. On the palate there is fruit sweetness and flavors of honeydew and cantaloupe. It is smooth and round in the mouth with a soft finish."
Umani Ronchi 2002 Jorio  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),Umani Ronchi,Red,Jorio,"Montepulciano, Italian Red","Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Central Italy, Italy",13%,$13,86,,"There's a distinctive aromatic element to this single-vineyard wine that resembles dried sweet herb or basil followed by generous tones of sweet berry fruit, toasted nuts and vanilla. Made from the hearty Montepulciano grape, the wine sees 11 months of wood aging (in both larger casks and smaller barrique) that help render flavors of exotic spice and cigar box. It's chewy and rich in the mouth and would pair well with grilled meats."
Novy 2013 Carlisle Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Novy,Red,Carlisle Vineyard,Zinfandel,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",15.3%,$34,91,Virginie Boone,"Complex, integrated and soft, this wine from fellow winemaker Mike Officer's historic site is lightly spiced in cinnamon and pepper. Dollops of vanilla and blackberry make themselves felt on the palate amid the zest."
Teusner 2015 Bilmore Shiraz (Barossa Valley),Teusner,Red,Bilmore,,"Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$25,89,Christina Pickard,"With aromas of cherry cough syrup and expensive oak, this is a big, rich, flashy Shiraz. Fine-grained tannins, balanced acidity and plenty of plush fruit mark the palate, but the oak is a little too much in the fore."
Belhurst 2010 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),Belhurst,White,Dry,Riesling,"Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12%,$19,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Notes of sweet quince and pommelo add a soft, blossomy character to this dry yet richly textured Riesling. Quite creamy on the palate, the finish is long, ending with a spray of crushed white pepper over tart grapefruit pith."
Ca' Rugate 2017 Monte Alto  (Soave Classico),Ca' Rugate,White,Monte Alto,"Garganega, Italian White","Soave Classico, Veneto, Italy",13%,$24,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Cedar, pressed yellow-flower, toasted nut and acacia aromas lift out of the glass. Fermented and aged in large casks and barriques, the palate offers oak, butterscotch, mature yellow apple and lemon drop before a bitter almond close."
CARM 2008 Vintage  (Port),CARM,Port/Sherry,Vintage,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",,,88,Roger Voss,"Soft, ripe fruit, already accessible. This has a generous feel and flavors of berries and red plums. Not a wine for aging, but very attractive."
Bougrier 2017 Pure Loire  (Rosé d'Anjou),Bougrier,Rose,Pure Loire,Rosé,"Rosé d'Anjou, Loire Valley, France",10.5%,$15,84,Roger Voss,The candy-pink color is a precursor to the sweetness of this wine. Strawberries are cut with squeezed-lemon flavors. The wine is bright and ready to drink.
Tikalo 2009 Rubens Tempranillo (Tierra de Castilla),Tikalo,Red,Rubens,Tempranillo,"Tierra de Castilla, Central Spain, Spain",13%,$11,85,Michael Schachner,"Nervy on the bouquet, with forceful, fiery red berry scents.

Schug 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Coast),Schug,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$18,86,,"An easy wine—this is zesty in acidity and slightly sweet in orange jam and pineapple flavors. The sweetness is the dominant feature, making it a good partner for slightly sweet foods, like teriyaki dishes."

It is an attractive wine that is ready to drink."
Sol Rouge 2014 Rosé (Lake County),Sol Rouge,Rose,,Rosé,"Lake County, Lake County, California, US",12.9%,$18,90,Jim Gordon,"An extroverted burst of meaty, minerally and fruity flavors defines this medium-bodied, firm-textured and concentrated wine. Imagine prosciutto wrapped around canteloupe for the flavor, plus vivid acidity and a lingering, almost smoky finish."
Williams Selyem 2003 Hawk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Williams Selyem,White,Hawk Hill Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$46,87,,"It's hard to describe this as Chablisian, given the 15-percent-plus alcohol, but that word captures its minerality. There's a flintiness underlying the oak, citrus and peach flavors of this bone-dry wine. Similar to grand cru Chablis—it's tough in its youth. Hard to tell where it's going."
Marqués de la Concordia 2016 Federico Paternina Banda Azul Crianza  (Rioja),Marqués de la Concordia,Red,Federico Paternina Banda Azul Crianza,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$16,83,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of compost, stale peanut and berry fruit carry the nose. In the mouth, this is raw and grabby, with tomato-like acidity. Green, earthy flavors of tomato and herbs are low on fruit and finish with a note of compost."
D'Alfonso-Curran 2018 Grüner Veltliner (Sta. Rita Hills),D'Alfonso-Curran,White,,Grüner Veltliner,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",13.1%,$38,92,Matt Kettmann,"There are fascinating aromas of cantaloupe balls, Meyer lemon peel and crushed chalk on the nose of this bottling. It's crisp and flavorful on the palate, loaded with orange sorbet and white flowers, yet sliced through with high acidity and a chalky mouthfeel."
Château Gemeillan 2016  Médoc,Château Gemeillan,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Médoc, Bordeaux, France",13%,$18,88,Roger Voss,"This wine comes from a small estate planted with equal proportions of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is balanced between fruit and a core of firm tannins. The aftertaste gives a smoother, ripe view of life."
Domaine Pellé 2018 Le Carroir  (Menetou-Salon),Domaine Pellé,White,Le Carroir,Sauvignon Blanc,"Menetou-Salon, Loire Valley, France",14%,$29,90,Roger Voss,"On flinty soil, the vines of this parcel have produced a wine that is smoky, mineral and tight. The fruit is concentrated and structured, demanding further aging. Drink from 2021."
Burgess 2004 Syrah (Napa Valley),Burgess,Red,,,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.7%,$22,87,,"There's a touch of raisiny overripeness in this dry Syrah, not a lot, but just enough to confuse the palate. Other than that, the wine is as smooth as can be, with a chocolate and bitter cherry finish."
Hillinger 2016 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg),Hillinger,Red,,"Blaufränkisch, Other Red","Leithaberg, Austria",13%,$39,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The exquisite freshness of tart, red cherry mingles with the perfume of cinnamon-sprinkled blueberries. The palate then presents wonderfully ripe but tart fruits of the forest, again with that lovely cinnamon inflection. The body is sinuous, slender but firm. The finish is gloriously spicy. A very elegant wine."
Sausal 1997 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),Sausal,Red,,Zinfandel,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$12,86,Joe Czerwinski,There's a slight gaminess to this wine that makes it more interesting than your average Zin. Also some black-pepper and licorice notes that add complexity. A solid effort at a fair price. Best Buy.
Von Othegraven 2004 Kanzem Altenberg Eiswein First Growth Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),Von Othegraven,Dessert,Kanzem Altenberg Eiswein First Growth,Riesling,"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, Germany",8%,$250,97,Joe Czerwinski,"Words hardly do this wine justice. It's unctuous almost beyond the point of being wine—offering a mèlange of dried fruits and honey that ooze over every taste bud, filling the pores of your mouth and then releasing sugar and flavor for minutes afterward. And the aromas aren't too shabby either, giving up intense scents of dried apricots and orange marmalade, tinged with tea-like notes that add a sense of lightness and complexity."
Domaine Gayrard 2019 Loin de l'Oeil (Gaillac),Domaine Gayrard,White,,"Loin de l'Oeil, Other White","Gaillac, Southwest France, France",13%,$26,93,Roger Voss,"Made from Loin de l'Oeil, the dominant white grape in Gaillac, this has produced a perfumed, stylish wine. With touches of green plums and a tangy and mineral texture, this is a ripe wine. The edge of spice and acidity at the end complete a wine that will be ready from 2022."

Château de Brigue 2010 Signature Red (Côtes de Provence),Château de Brigue,Red,Signature,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Côtes de Provence, Provence, France",12.5%,$17,86,Roger Voss,"This is herbal, with some flavors of green bell pepper and wild spice.

Quady North 2016 Pistoleta White (Rogue Valley),Quady North,White,Pistoleta,Rhône-style White Blend,"Rogue Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",13.4%,$20,91,Paul Gregutt,"Close to half Viognier, this is cofermented with Roussanne and Marsanne, then blended with 7% Grenache Blanc. A small portion of the Viognier was fermented in Acacia oak. Deep and rich flavors are packed with sliced pear, then range on through oranges and mixed citrus, adding a touch of vanilla in a fresh tangy lingering finish."
XYZin 2008 50 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),XYZin,Red,50,Zinfandel,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$30,85,,"A tasty Zin, rich and elaborately layered, with wild red berry, chocolate, spice, gingerbread cookie, brown sugar and sandalwood flavors. A bit too sweet and soft, though."
Williams Selyem 2003 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Williams Selyem,Red,Ferrington Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",,$59,89,,"Whoa—this is a tough, acidic baby on opening. No way you want to drink it immediately. Give it time, either by decanting or cellaring. It's  big, dry and tart, stuffed with black cherry, cola, coffee and Asian spice flavors. Best after 2007."
Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2009 Bernkasteler Badstube Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,White,Bernkasteler Badstube Spätlese,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",8.5%,$28,89,Joe Czerwinski,"Medium-bodied and lush, powered by ripe fruit flavors of apple, peach and pineapple. There's a bit of a flinty note on the nose and a slight vinyl-like element on the finish, which add either complexity or detract from the fruit, depending on your perspective."
Castello di Radda 2015  Chianti Classico,Castello di Radda,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$13,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Ripe plum, black-skinned berry and pressed violet aromas take center stage. The no-frills but savory palate offers fleshy Morello cherry and ground clove set against solid tannins. Drink through 2019."
Réserve des Oliviers 2009 White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),Réserve des Oliviers,White,,Rhône-style White Blend,"Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rhône Valley, France",,$40,90,Joe Czerwinski,"Not a big, overwhelming blockbuster, this harmonious blend of equal parts Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Clairette and Bourboulenc features ripe citrus and pineapple flavors, with a hint of melon thrown in for good measure. It's pleasantly medium bodied and creamy in the mouth, with a reasonably long finish. Drink it over the next 12–18 months."
Castello di Monsanto 1995 Chianti Classico Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Castello di Monsanto,Red,Chianti Classico Riserva,Sangiovese,"Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",,$22,86,Michael Schachner,"Medium-bodied with a light tint, this is a warm wine full of red-currant flavor and hefty tannins. The finish is long as can be, with a pronounced touch of interesting wood. Very tangy and lean, this may improve down the line. Now it's a little closed and lean."
Écluse 2016 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),Écluse,Red,,Zinfandel,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.9%,$40,90,Matt Kettmann,"Dusty black cherry, baked earth and chaparral spices show on the nose of this bottling. There is decent tension to the palate, where black-cherry flavors compete for attention with dried thyme and savory sagebrush tones."

Michelle & Dr. Loosen,Dessert,Eroica Ice Wine,Riesling,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",9%,$60,94,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas pop, with notes of diesel, lychee, dried orange peel, marmalade and peach. The stone-fruit and tropical flavors are rich, sugary and intense, showing an exquisite sense of balance. Skip the rest of dessert. This delivers it all by itself."
Hillinger 2017 Pinot Blanc (Leithaberg),Hillinger,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Leithaberg, Austria",12.5%,$39,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Most subtle hazelnut notes envelop smoke and creaminess on the nose. The balanced palate is rounder than expected with a mellow stone fruit juiciness that sits well with the subtle smokiness that speaks of well-handled oak. A lovely texture completes this subtle, rounded and mellow yet fresh wine."
Husch 2006 Chardonnay (Mendocino),Husch,White,,Chardonnay,"Mendocino, Mendocino County, California, US",13.9%,$15,87,,"It's all about acidity and long hangtime with this Chard. The acids come from chilly, foggy nights, the ripeness from long, warm, sunny days. What you get is oodles of bright, pure pineapple, Granny Smith apple, Meyer lemon and spicy clove flavor, with a touch of caramelized oak for richness."
Uitkyk 1999 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),Uitkyk,Red,Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",13.5%,$18,83,,"Oak runs rampant here, swamping the dark red berry fruit with ashphalt, licorice and toast, toast, toast. The modest fruit is hard to find. Quite dry and not well-balanced, with overtly woody tannins."
Greywacke 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Greywacke,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13%,$23,92,Joe Czerwinski,"Former Cloudy Bay boss Kevin Judd scores big in this challenging vintage.

Maidenstoen 2020 Grüner Veltliner (Edna Valley),Maidenstoen,White,,Grüner Veltliner,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.7%,$20,93,Matt Kettmann,"From vines grown on a steep, east-facing slope, this bottling begins with aromas of Key lime peel, caviar-lime flesh, green-fleshed kiwi and even some lychee on the nose. There's a great sizzle of acidity to the sip as well as a compelling grip, framing seashore-like flavors of fresh kelp, green citrus peels and cut grass."
Baxter 2009 Oppenlander Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino),Baxter,Red,Oppenlander Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Mendocino, Mendocino County, California, US",13.5%,$45,93,Virginie Boone,"Structured and fully developed, this showcases the strong 2009 vintage, the Oppenlander Vineyard and the brilliance that is Baxter. Marked by bright black-cherry fruit and a heady perfume of rose, this carries itself with elegance and a light touch. This is Pinot Noir purposely made to pair with food."
The Infinite Monkey Theorem 2018 Cabernet Franc (Colorado),The Infinite Monkey Theorem,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"Colorado, Colorado, US",13.2%,$25,88,Fiona Adams,"Raspberry and cherry pop on the nose, with some vanilla, pepper and leather tones adding depth. The tannins offer gentle grip, but the acidity is tart and sunny, keeping this fresh and structured, and giving a solid base to flavors of ripe plum and tart cranberry wrapped in vanilla. It finishes on tart berry, with lingering tannins making this a good match for fatty protein."
Apaltagua 2013 Reserva Unoaked Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),Apaltagua,White,Reserva Unoaked,Chardonnay,"Casablanca Valley, Chile",13.5%,$12,82,Michael Schachner,"Mealy white-fruit aromas are lacking in clarity and freshness, while the flavor profile is based on pineapple.

Smooth and juicy, the palate offers blackberry jam, ripe black cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside soft, supple tannins. It's made to be enjoyed young, so drink soon."
Château Bousquette 2001 Red (Saint-Chinian),Château Bousquette,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Saint-Chinian, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",,$15,85,Roger Voss,"The standard cuvée from Château  Bousquette has light, fresh simple fruit, with good flavors of red plums and fruit tannins. It is finished with balancing acidity, and is certainly ready to drink now."
Boeckel 2012 Zotzenberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),Boeckel,White,Zotzenberg Grand Cru,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",14%,,91,Roger Voss,"A rich and medium sweet wine, full of spice, lychees and ripe fruits. There is a tangy texture, a strong sense of minerality as well as herb, yellow fruits and nutmeg flavors. It is still young and needs time. Drink from 2017."

Mommessin 2009 Beaujolais Nouveau  (Beaujolais),Mommessin,Red,Beaujolais Nouveau,Gamay,"Beaujolais, Beaujolais, France",12.5%,$13,85,Roger Voss,"A fat style with good berry fruits and tannins. The fresh acidity is of course present, but fits well with the raspberry and cherry flavors. Screwcap."
Marston Family 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),Marston Family,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Spring Mountain District, Napa, California, US",14.8%,$90,91,,"The vineyard, on Spring Mountain, has been the source of very good Cabs from both Marston and Beringer, and the '04 continues that tradition. Made in the modern style, this is soft and very ripe to the point of sweetness. But it pulls back at the last minute, allowing the cassis, chocolate and red cherry flavors to finish dry. Best with something simple, like a grilled steak."
Union de Producteurs de Saint-Émilion 2016 Château Tuilerie Plaisance  (Montagne-Saint-Émilion),Union de Producteurs de Saint-Émilion,Red,Château Tuilerie Plaisance,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Montagne-Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$55,90,Roger Voss,"This wine has structure and the potential for aging.

It's a big, textural, palate-filling wine, smooth and a bit tannic. There's a touch of green tea in those tannins, and it finishes with a hint of heat. Drink now–2025."
Fratelli Berlucchi 2005 Brut Millesimato  (Franciacorta),Fratelli Berlucchi,Sparkling,Brut Millesimato,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Franciacorta, Lombardy, Italy",12.5%,,90,,"This is a harmonious and elegant sparkler that offers well-integrated aromas of citrus blossom, honey and stone fruit.

The flavors of honeyed apple, nectarine and lime are sweet and the wine round and plump in the mouth, but then electric acids kick in, providing great balance through the long finish. Exciting to try now, but this wine should age 10-plus years without any trouble at all."
Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2009 Premium Red (Alentejo),Adega Cooperativa de Borba,Red,Premium,Portuguese Red,"Alentejo, Portugal",14.5%,,90,Roger Voss,"This is a top wine from the Borba cooperative.

Sullivan,"This is a rare, 100% varietal Cinsault from Olsen Vineyard that saw only neutral French oak, and it's hard to imagine a more pure representation of the variety. Aromas of tart red fruit and flowers with high-toned stem accents are followed by piercingly pure, elegantly styled fruit and savory flavors that undulate across the palate. The balance is exquisite. It stands up beautifully on its own but will truly sing at the dinner table. Pair it with lamb."
Stift Göttweig 2010 Silberbichl Erste Lage Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),Stift Göttweig,White,Silberbichl Erste Lage Reserve,Riesling,"Kremstal, Austria",13%,$32,93,Roger Voss,"The vineyards of the Benedictine monastery of Göttweig are now run by the Stadt Krems winemaking team.

This 2012 is structured while also full of ripe fruit. The tannins lie behind the juicy red fruitiness and the immediately attractive ripe flavors. It should age, but not for long. Drink from 2017."
Undurraga 2013 Altazor Red (Maipo Valley),Undurraga,Red,Altazor,"Cabernet Blend, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Maipo Valley, Chile",14%,$70,91,Michael Schachner,"On the nose, this Cabernet-led blend deals telltale Chilean aromas of herbs, pepper, spice, berry, tomato and forest floor. Derivative of a cool year, the palate feels tight, with snapping acidity. Hard-hitting acid-driven flavors of spiced berry and black currant finish dark, toasty and oaky, but pulling. Drink through 2025."
Chanticleer 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Chanticleer,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$45,91,,"A complex wine, brimming with cinnamon and spice flavors and redolent of coffee, chocolate, black cherry, black currant, raspberry, herb and anise flavors.

Exceptionally ripe in grapefruit, lime and gooseberry fruit, it shows the minerality of this vineyard that gives the wine grip and grounding. Bone-dry, with crisp supportive acidity and just the right amount of oak, it's wonderful now. This is not a wine to age, but will hold over the next four years."
Piña 2007 Mimbre Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Piña,Red,Mimbre,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15.5%,$115,90,,"As soft and smooth as velvet, with superripe flavors of chocolate, blackberry and cherry pie filling, currants, cassis and sweetly toasted oak. A best blend of vineyards available to the winery, this Cab was aged in 100% new French oak. The alcohol level is high, leading to questions of ageability."
Beni di Batasiolo 2008 Metodo Classico Sparkling (Vino Spumante),Beni di Batasiolo,Sparkling,Metodo Classico,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Vino Spumante, Italy Other, Italy",13%,$39,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made from Pinot Nero and Chardonnay, this delivers sensations of bread crust, toasted walnut, lemon drop and red apple.

It's a very interesting wine, with real class and style."
Joseph Jewell 2011 Appian Way Vineyards Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Joseph Jewell,Red,Appian Way Vineyards,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.44%,$39,92,Virginie Boone,"This Pinot is joyous in fresh berry fruit aromas and flavors, from wild strawberry to taut cherry, the fruit buoyed by lush, velvety tannins and generous acidity.

Rios de Chile 2013 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),Rios de Chile,White,Reserva,Sauvignon Blanc,"Leyda Valley, Chile",13.5%,$17,83,Michael Schachner,"Vegetal aromas outmuscle the wine's green fruit character.

The structure is soft, open and elegant, surrounding the core of sweet tannins. Not for long-term aging, but worth waiting 4–5 years."
Harmony Cellars 2015 Chardonnay (Central Coast),Harmony Cellars,White,,Chardonnay,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",13.4%,$22,88,Matt Kettmann,"This ripe Chardonnay is a successful example of its style, with honeysuckle, white peach and marshmallow aromas on the nose.

Albeno Munari 2006 Syrah (Calaveras County),Albeno Munari,Red,,,"Calaveras County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",15.3%,$16,84,,"Chunky and tannic in the mouth, with a sandpapery texture housing ripe flavors of blackberries, currants and raisins.

La Carmina 2020 Albariño (Rías Baixas),La Carmina,White,,Albariño,"Rías Baixas, Galicia, Spain",13%,,86,Michael Schachner,"Powdery white fruit aromas are honeyed and come with a note of sea foam.

It's tough, and hard to see how it can really soften sufficiently to allow the fruit to surface."
Chloe 2017 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),Chloe,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",13.9%,$18,86,Matt Kettmann,"Dark-red-fruit and boysenberry aromas meet with wet gravel on the nose of this bottling.

Plantagenet 2008 Shiraz (Mount Barker),Plantagenet,Red,,,"Mount Barker, Western Australia, Australia",14.2%,$29,91,Joe Czerwinski,"All three of Plantagenet's Shirazes were successful in 2008. This, the flagship bottling, offers aromas of coffee grounds, cherry and cracked black pepper, adding vanilla, spice and charred beef flavors on the palate. It's harmonious, savory and complex. Drink now–2020 and possibly beyond."
Alces Gallus 2020 White (Côtes de Gascogne),Alces Gallus,White,,White Blend,"Côtes de Gascogne, Southwest France, France",12%,$14,86,Roger Voss,"Fresh and light with white-currant fruits, this wine celebrates bright, zesty crispness and easy drinking. It is ready now."
Fairview 2007 Pinotage (Paarl),Fairview,Red,,Pinotage,"Paarl, South Africa",14.5%,$15,87,Susan Kostrzewa,"A rich nose of cherry, mocha and jam rolls into mouthfilling flavors that offer a spicy but elegant blend in this stylish Pinotage. Smoke, cherry and plum unfold in the mouth. The finish is lingering and spirited. Pair with spicy grilled lamb, steak, or even curry."
Canterbury House 1999 Pinot Noir (Waipara),Canterbury House,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Waipara, New Zealand",13.5%,$19,82,Michael Schachner,"Almost translucent, with a mixed-spice nose that doesn't offer much fruit.  It's got some strawberry and rasberry flavors, but it's also slightly sour.  Milk chocolate shows up on the finish, which is otherwise overly oaky.  Lacks polish."
Wolfberger 2016 Pinot Gris (Alsace),Wolfberger,White,,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13.5%,$20,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,Slight notes of yellow pear appear gently on the nose and become fully-fledged on the soft easy fruit-driven palate. A dollop of residual sweetness helps these fruity flavors along. An edge of bitter zestiness and freshness contains the fruit. This finishes off dry but fresh.
Bodegas Muriel 2014 Pazo Cilleiro Albariño (Rías Baixas),Bodegas Muriel,White,Pazo Cilleiro,Albariño,"Rías Baixas, Galicia, Spain",12.5%,$20,87,Michael Schachner,"Don't let the gold color fool you, this is quite vital with floral, leesy, almost grassy aromas. Bracing acidity is at the core with clover, grass, quince and sour-apricot flavors. Blasting acidity is a force on the finish."
Jacùss 2004 Picolit (Colli Orientali del Friuli),Jacùss,Dessert,,"Picolit, Italian White","Colli Orientali del Friuli, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13%,$68,90,,"Here is a saturated and bright dessert wine with a deep orange color and aromas of toasted nut, chestnut, honey, yellow rose and mature peach. These tones are rich and dense and the wine exhibits thick, chewy viscosity in the mouth."
Maragas 2016 Tootsie White (Oregon),Maragas,Dessert,Tootsie,White Blend,"Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",10.5%,$22,86,Paul Gregutt,"This bears little resemblance to previous versions; though listed as a dessert wine, it is only passingly sweet. Perhaps orange wine is a better description, with some 21 grapes in the blend, principally various Muscat clones. It's an odd mix of grainy sugar and astringent phenolics, and will not readily accompany any desserts with the possible exception of bitter chocolate."
Anakena 2011 Tama Vineyard Selection Malbec (Cachapoal Valley),Anakena,Red,Tama Vineyard Selection,Malbec,"Cachapoal Valley, Chile",13%,$16,86,Michael Schachner,"Medicinal cherry aromas are a touch herbal and green, but also floral. This red-tinted Malbec is jammy on the palate, with lightly herbal plum and currant flavors. The zesty finish brings a cool-vintage green character into play."
Domaine de l'Hermitage 2009 L'Oratoire Rosé (Bandol),Domaine de l'Hermitage,Rose,L'Oratoire,Rosé,"Bandol, Provence, France",13.5%,,90,Roger Voss,"While it is rich and powerful, this wine also has a great presence of fresh fruits, lifted by red cherries and acidity. The texture offers red apple skins and some tight tannins."
Pence 2010 Uplands Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),Pence,Red,Uplands,Pinot Noir,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$40,88,,"This darkly colored, tannic, young wine boasts lots of rich black cherry, currant, cola, pie-spice and sandalwood flavors. It also has a rich mushroomy streak. A bit angular and jagged now, give it 5–6 years in the cellar and see what it does."
Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2016 Réserve Pinot Noir (Alsace),Domaine Barmès-Buecher,Red,Réserve,Pinot Noir,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$34,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The nose is very shy but gives the slightest promise of ripe, red fruit. Red cherry appears in full splendor on the palate, edged by racy, exciting freshness and superfine but crunchy tannins. The body remains slender but there is a sensuous, warm core of ripe fruit. Lovely now but will develop over the coming five years. Drink 2018–2025."
Wohlmuth 2000 Summus Sauvignon Blanc (South Styria),Wohlmuth,White,Summus,Sauvignon Blanc,"South Styria, Austria",13%,$18,83,Joe Czerwinski,"Despite a rush of pungent herbaceousness and cat pee, the flavors are sweetly fruity and low in acid. Rich and a bit heavy. —J.C."
Bodegas Escorihuela 2005 Cruz Alta Reserve Malbec (Mendoza),Bodegas Escorihuela,Red,Cruz Alta Reserve,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$13,86,Michael Schachner,"Starts with roasted coffee, berry liqueur and toast, while the palate is pretty dense and loaded with boysenberry and cherry. The feel is solid and juicy, with firm acids and tannins supporting a peppery finish. Saturated and staunch, but ordinary."
Rippey NV The Crossing Red (Napa Valley),Rippey,Red,The Crossing,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.6%,$20,86,Virginie Boone,There's a puckering dryness to the palate of this wine at first sip. Over time it opens slowly into elements of strawberry-rhubarb and grenadine syrup. The firm tannins in this mix of a majority Merlot with Pinot Noir make their presence felt.
Manastira 2016 Riverside Chardonnay (Thracian Valley),Manastira,White,Riverside,Chardonnay,,13.5%,$16,88,Jeff Jenssen,"This Chardonnay has vanilla, lemon blossom and peach aromas. Lemon curd and green apple flavors come through on the palate before a pleasantly acidic finish."
Lambert Bridge 1999 Merlot (Sonoma County),Lambert Bridge,Red,,Merlot,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",13.9%,$24,92,,"Seems very oaky, with in-your-face aromas of vanilla, char and pepper, but the fruit is able to support it. In fact, the underlying flavors are rich and gorgeous. It shows Cabernet's cassis and blackberry aromatics, with the soft tannins and velvety, drink-me-now texture of Merlot."
Matua Valley 2004 Matheson Syrah (Hawke's Bay),Matua Valley,Red,Matheson,,"Hawke's Bay, New Zealand",,,84,Joe Czerwinski,"Light and a bit herbal, like a pleasant St.-Joseph. White pepper and celery-leaf notes accent tart cherries."
Lucas & Lewellen 2005 Goodchild Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),Lucas & Lewellen,White,Goodchild Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",14%,$22,86,,"Many wineries have taken fruit from this vineyard, generally with good results. The '05 Lucas & Lewellen shows its terroir, with a cool-climate crispness backing up ripe pineapple tart, nectarine and papaya flavors. But the oak-inspired caramel, char and butterscotch is a bit heavy-handed."
La Rajade 2018 Sauvignon (Collio),La Rajade,White,,"Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc","Collio, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13%,$18,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"This has aromas evoking graphite, grapefruit and botanical herb. The aromas march on to the racy palate along with a hint of dried pineapple and mature yellow apple skin before a fennel finish."
Maimai 2014 Syrah (Hawke's Bay),Maimai,Red,,,"Hawke's Bay, New Zealand",14%,$20,89,Christina Pickard,"The nose on this distinctive Syrah is a mélange of beef teriyaki, aniseed, stewed raspberry and cherry aromas. Oak influence is marked, particularly on the palate, where the juicy red fruit notes and star anise are slightly overwhelmed by a dried bark finish. Nevertheless, this is a savory style many will enjoy."
De Loach 1997 Saitone Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),De Loach,Red,Saitone Ranch,Zinfandel,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$20,90,Paul Gregutt,"One of the best of the single-ranch wines from De Loach, the Saitone's nose exhibits a lot of coffee and smoke aromas. The mouthfeel is fat, meaty and rich. Bright and edgy, with good acids and a long, sharp finish. A well-made and complex wine."
Hyatt 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),Hyatt,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13%,$15,87,Paul Gregutt,"Forward and softly fruity in the nose, it blends into a pleasant melange of roses, cherries and chocolate. Flavors mingle leaf and flower, fruit and root, with modest tannins and a good balance."
Friedrich Becker 2018 Becker Family Pinot Gris (Pfalz),Friedrich Becker,White,Becker Family,,"Pfalz, Germany",13%,$24,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Pinot Gris (aka Pinot Grigio) is a pink-hued grape and this pretty, coppery-pink wine tiptoes the line between a white and rosé wine. Macerated on its skins for 12–18 hours, it offers concentrated raspberry and red apple flavors against a backdrop of citrusy acidity and a clean mineral tang. Dry and delightfully refreshing, it's a fantastic year-round accompaniment to everything from fish to game."
Uppercut 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Uppercut,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$25,86,,"This is has classic blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. The feeling on the palate feels a little rough, though."
Kingston Family 2014 CJ's Barrel Syrah (Casablanca Valley),Kingston Family,Red,CJ's Barrel,,"Casablanca Valley, Chile",14%,$42,90,Michael Schachner,"Ripe, loamy cherry and blackberry aromas are moderately complex. Racy on the palate courtesy of punchy, fresh acidity, this barrel-select Syrah tastes spicy and a touch charred, with a black-fruit base. Smooth on the finish, with mild residual oak, this is elegant as a whole. Drink through 2020."
Château Lagrézette 2015 Le Rosé de Julie Rosé (Côtes du Lot),Château Lagrézette,Rose,Le Rosé de Julie,Rosé,"Côtes du Lot, Southwest France, France",13%,$25,87,Roger Voss,"Produced from Malbec and fashionably pale, this wine is named after Julie Perrin, daughter of owner Alain-Dominique Perrin. It is light and deliciously crisp and refreshing. Bone dry, it is certainly a food rosé, although with its light raspberry flavor it will also be good as an apéritif. Julie Perrin, an artist, worked on the blend and created the château watercolor on the bottle."
Buttonwood Grove 2015 Frances Amelia Riesling (Finger Lakes),Buttonwood Grove,White,Frances Amelia,Riesling,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12%,$25,86,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Vibrant lemon and tangerine acidity freshens savory tones of pressed apples and nuts in this slightly rustic earthy Riesling. It's dry on the palate and finishes briskly.
Domaine Tariquet 2018 Chardonnay Chardonnay (Côtes de Gascogne),Domaine Tariquet,White,Chardonnay,Chardonnay,"Côtes de Gascogne, Southwest France, France",11.5%,$14,88,Roger Voss,"This is a light Chardonnay, with an attractive creamy character and touches of butter. A soft texture and light, juicy acidity give the wine a rounded aftertaste. Drink now."
Babcock 1997 Eleven Oaks Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley),Babcock,Red,Eleven Oaks,Sangiovese,"Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",,$30,90,,"Dark and brooding, this needs some serious time in the cellar or in a decanter before it opens up and begins to express its Sangiovese character. Generously oaked, it shows good depth and richness of fruit. Tannins are plentiful but soft."
Domaine Rotier 2009 L'Ame Red (Gaillac),Domaine Rotier,Red,L'Ame,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Gaillac, Southwest France, France",,$45,93,Roger Voss,"A smooth, wood-matured wine, this shows all of the richness of Braucol and Duras. Named “the spirit,” it is a true evocation of the rugged nature of Gaillac, with a mineral streak and a big black-fruit flavor. Age for 4–5 years."
Domaine Nathalie & Gilles Fevre 2019  Chablis,Domaine Nathalie & Gilles Fevre,White,,Chardonnay,"Chablis, Burgundy, France",12.5%,$19,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A hint of gunflint on the nose of this wine accents ripe, intensely sunny flavors of yellow plum, pear and lemon. Moderately full in body but briskly balanced, it's a rich expression of Chablis anchored by a chalky, subtly salty finish. At peak now–2027."
Lagarde 2010 Malbec (Mendoza),Lagarde,Red,,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.8%,$18,88,Michael Schachner,"Big and boisterous on the nose, with ripe plum, berry, smoke and meaty aromas. Mouthfilling and edgy feeling, with bold berry and plum flavors that feature an herbal, peppery aftertaste. Earthy and herbal leaning on the lengthy finish."
J. Lohr 2018 Shotwell Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (El Pomar District),J. Lohr,Red,Shotwell Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"El Pomar District, Central Coast, California, US",15.3%,$45,90,Matt Kettmann,"Soft aromas of baked cherry meet with rich mahogany and cola on the nose of this bottling. The palate picks up shiitake, pepper and tar flavors, with sticky tannins that carry the ripe red fruit to the finish."
Domaine Chevillon-Chezeaux 2017 Les Crots Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Domaine Chevillon-Chezeaux,Red,Les Crots Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Nuits-St.-Georges, Burgundy, France",13%,$74,90,Roger Voss,"This small-production wine comes from the few rows owned in this vineyard by this estate. It is developing well as a succulent wine with great charm as well as plenty of ripe red fruits. Tannins and acidity are now fully integrated into the wine, which will be ready to drink from 2021."
Matanzas Creek 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Bennett Valley),Matanzas Creek,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Bennett Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.1%,$30,88,,"There's a touch of honeyed sweetness to this wine that gives it a softly appealing taste. The orange, apricot, tropical fruit and vanilla flavors are absolutely delicious, while there's just enough acidity to lift and balance the richness."
Steltzner 2001 Claret Red (Napa Valley),Steltzner,Red,Claret,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$16,84,,"It would be nice to report that this affordable Napa Bordeaux blend is as good as wines costing twice as much, but it's not. It's not bad, but quite thin and herbal, with a tannic finish."
Lindemans 2001 Bin 65 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),Lindemans,White,Bin 65,Chardonnay,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",13%,$9,84,Joe Czerwinski,"Probably the wine that put Australian Chardonnay on American consumers' maps, the current vintage boasts aromas of creamery butter, tangerine and lime, with a touch of movie-theater popcorn. Soft peach and vanilla flavors finish with spicy oak."
Kosta Browne 2019 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Kosta Browne,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14.1%,$115,94,Jim Gordon,"Wonderful spearmint and cinnamon accents light up this focused, fruit-driven and well-balanced wine. Light tannins and lip-smacking acidity do a great job of lifting the ample red cherry and rhubarb flavors as the complexity of this wine unfolds on the palate and lingering finish. Best through 2029."
Boneshaker 2011 Zinfandel (Lodi),Boneshaker,Red,,Zinfandel,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",15%,$25,87,Virginie Boone,"This crowd-pleasing Zin is deeply aromatic, with cedar notes, and boasts a palate that's smooth, leathery and layered with tones of earth and black tea. Fairly priced and with a cleverly designed label, it's a great bottle to take to your next biker party or gathering for the Day of the Dead."
Morandé 2008 Gran Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),Morandé,Red,Gran Reserva,Merlot,"Maipo Valley, Chile",14.5%,$16,85,Michael Schachner,"Big, oaky and roasted up front, with charred aromas. The palate is full but clacky, with piercing acidity leading to a saucy, sharp set of tangy red berry and herb flavors. There's a chocolaty element to smooth things out on the finish, but it's always snappy and sheer."
De Stefani NV Zero Gran Cuvée Extra Dry  (Prosecco),De Stefani,Sparkling,Zero Gran Cuvée Extra Dry,"Glera, Italian White","Prosecco, Veneto, Italy",11%,$20,86,,"Very crisp, focused and clean, this easy sparkling wine does a great job of keeping the palate refreshed. It's an Extra Dry expression which means there's just a tiny touch of sweetness in the mouth."
Silvestri 2007 Bella Sandra Chardonnay (Carmel Valley),Silvestri,White,Bella Sandra,Chardonnay,"Carmel Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.4%,$20,82,,"Even though this wine is nicely dry and crisp, it's too vegetal, with a green bean taste."
Bernhard Huber 2011 Bienenberg Erste Lage R GG Spätburgunder (Baden),Bernhard Huber,Red,Bienenberg Erste Lage R GG,"Spätburgunder, Pinot Noir","Baden, Germany",13%,$103,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"The better (by just a whisker) of Huber's 2011 Pinot Noirs, the Bienenberg is distinctly fragrant of cherry blossoms and rose. Tart red cherry and cranberry flavors are streaked with saltwater and stone, finishing on a lingering mineral tone. It's bold, yet elegantly structured."
Château de Beaulieu 2016  Montagne-Saint-Émilion,Château de Beaulieu,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Montagne-Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",13%,$45,90,Roger Voss,"Twelve months in wood and rich tannins have combined to give this wine a strong, structured character. A juicy underlay from the black-plum flavors and the acidity will likely continue to give this wine an edge of freshness even as it matures. Drink this stylish wine from 2021."
Buty 2013 62% Semillon 22% Sauvignon Blanc 16% Muscadelle White (Columbia Valley (WA)),Buty,White,62% Semillon 22% Sauvignon Blanc 16% Muscadelle,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.1%,$25,89,Sean P. Sullivan,"A blend of fruit from Boushey, Rosebud Ranch and Lonesome Springs Ranch, this wine was aged in concrete and seasoned French oak. Aromas of fig, apricot, orange peel and lees are followed by creamy flavors that have a light, elegant style."
Marcarini 2003 Brunate  (Barolo),Marcarini,Red,Brunate,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$59,85,,"As a fan of this traditional winery, I was a little disppointed by the Brunate. Less focussed and interesting than the La Serra, the Brunate had a muted nose of dark fruit, and woodsmoke although the fruit seemed a little more pronounced on the palate. A short medium finish."
Diora 2017 La Splendeur du Soleil Chardonnay (Monterey),Diora,White,La Splendeur du Soleil,Chardonnay,"Monterey, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$22,93,Matt Kettmann,"Bright aromas of lemon candy, sea spray and lime balm meets with a touch of pastry on the nose. Richer flavors of white peach and sea salt ride a light and bright texture on the palate, which grows more oaky toward the finish."
Caprio Cellars 2018 Sanitella Estate Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Caprio Cellars,Red,Sanitella Estate,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.3%,$88,92,Sean P. Sullivan,"Cabernet Sauvignon (46%) is in the lead, followed by Merlot (27%), Malbec (18%) and Cabernet Franc (9%). The aromas bring notes of dark cherry, plum, cocoa, fresh herbs and fresh black currant. The palate is all about sophistication and detail, with a velvety feel to the fruit flavors. It's pleasantly unadorned by obviously overt new oak and brings the freshness of the vintage."
Jean-Louis & Fabienne Mann 2011 Resonance Sélection de Grains Nobles Riesling (Alsace),Jean-Louis & Fabienne Mann,Dessert,Resonance Sélection de Grains Nobles,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",11%,$75,97,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Intense notes of fir honey and caramelized peach have heady lift on the nose of this wine, lending an elixir-like urgency. The concentrated palate displays these flavors against a strong backdrop of beeswax and honeycomb. Intense sweetness homes in on a candied lemon core while the luscious finish rings with honey, wax and lemony caramel. Drink through 2050."
Sylla Sebaste 2013  Barolo,Sylla Sebaste,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$39,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with delicate aromas of baking spice, rose petal and leather. The firm straightforward palate offers sour cherry, clove and green peppercorn alongside assertive tannins."
Dopff Au Moulin 2018 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),Dopff Au Moulin,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$14,87,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Hints of ripe pear and Mirabelle on the nose of this wine are subtle. The palate is fresh and light, dulling the fruit with a hint of earthiness. The finish is dry and fresh."
Dr. Loosen 2014 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),Dr. Loosen,White,Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",7.5%,VivinoGary's Wine,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Bold, penetrating yellow-cherry and pink grapefruit flavors are calibrated by streaks of lime, lemon and slate in this invigorating kabinett. Kicks of saffron and spice accentuate its pert, racy style. Enjoy now through 2018 for fresh, fruity refreshment."
Cadaretta 2010 Roughout Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cadaretta,Red,Roughout,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.9%,$15,87,Paul Gregutt,"Roughout is a fun wine, with a burst of sweet cherry fruit opening into a wild side that veers toward bramble and forest flavors. It's not a big red, but highly gulp-able and perfect for a burger night."
Quinta da Romaneira 2009 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),Quinta da Romaneira,Port/Sherry,Late Bottled Vintage,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",19.5%,,90,Roger Voss,"The wine was fermented in open stone lagars, still the preferred method at many Douro quintas. That gives the color and the soft extraction in this ripe, sweet Port. It has enough tannins to balance the dried raisin and superripe plum flavors. While it has been bottled to drink now, the wine will benefit from aging. Drink from 2016."
Bianchi 2008 Signature Selection Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles),Bianchi,Red,Signature Selection,Cabernet Franc,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$19,86,,"Soft, sweet and a little hot, this has flavors of chocolate-covered raisin and black cherry jam. It's an easy wine to drink now with a nice grilled steak or juicy burger."
Umberto Cesari 2007 Riserva  (Sangiovese di Romagna),Umberto Cesari,Red,Riserva,Sangiovese,"Sangiovese di Romagna, Central Italy, Italy",13%,,88,,"Packaged in a big, heavy bottle, this Riserva Sangiovese shows elegant tones of wild berry, blue flowers, moist earth and spice. This is a very traditional take on Italy's favorite indigenous variety with a soft, silky close."
Gran Verano 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),Gran Verano,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Central Valley, Chile",13.5%,$23,83,Michael Schachner,"Melony aromas are soft and candied. On the palate, this is watery and doesn't offer much sizzle. Pithy citrus flavors are typical of Chilean SB, however this is flat on the finish."
Ridge 2007 Geyserville Red (Sonoma County),Ridge,Red,Geyserville,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$35,87,,"Made from Zinfandel, Carignane, Petite Sirah and Mataro (Mourvèdre), this hearty wine currently is sweet and full in primary cherry, blackberry, plum and cedar flavors, with a touch of raisins in the finish. It should slowly develop over the next 4–6 years before heading inexorably downhill."
Silvano Bolmida 2011 Bussia Vigna dei Fantini  (Barolo),Silvano Bolmida,Red,Bussia Vigna dei Fantini,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",,$50,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of toasted oak, menthol, marinated plum and a hint of wet animal fur lead the nose. The palate is still tight and rather closed, offering raw red berry, licorice and oak sensations supported by raspy tannins."
Forgeron 2007 Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain),Forgeron,Red,Klipsun Vineyard,Merlot,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.4%,$48,88,Paul Gregutt,"Released more than four years after harvest, this astringent, oaky Merlot remains in a dumb phase. Barrel flavors of bourbon and vanilla quickly take over the nose and the palate, though there is a suggestion of compact power and black fruit lurking in the background. Give it a lot of decanting time."
Domaine la Mereuille 2008 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),Domaine la Mereuille,Red,,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rhône Valley, France",14%,$50,86,Joe Czerwinski,"Already mature, this medium-bodied wine offers scents of dried fruit and leather, then flavors of caramelized, roasted black cherries and more leather. It's a bit coarsely textured, then falls away on the finish. Drink soon."
Emeritus 2017 Hallberg Ranch Wesley's Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Emeritus,Red,Hallberg Ranch Wesley's Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.8%,$75,94,Virginie Boone,"This is a juicy, effusive wine, made from several of the vineyard's prized blocks year after year. Pomegranate, rhubarb and dried herb highlight a length of concentrated blackberry and rich robust tannin. Elegant from start to end, the finish is a mix of black pepper and black tea, and is earthy in forest floor."
Stadt Krems 2016 Ried Wachtberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),Stadt Krems,White,Ried Wachtberg Reserve,Grüner Veltliner,"Kremstal, Austria",13%,$44,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A creamy whiff of fresh, juicy yellow pear creates a most appetizing nose in this wine. That pure, friendly fruit dominates the palate, illuminating a background of spice and herb notes that recall dried sage and fennel seed. Lemon freshness frames everything and makes for a lovely, full-flavored mouthful."
Domaine Begude 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Domaine Begude,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Vin de Pays d'Oc, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",12%,$13,84,,"Crisp acidity marks this mouthwatering white. Intense aromas of lemon and grass make for an intriguing nose. The palate is a bit dull, although the acidity gives the minerally finish a bit of staying power and makes it a good foil for fresh seafood."
Thomas Fogarty 2007 Michaud Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone),Thomas Fogarty,Red,Michaud Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Chalone, Central Coast, California, US",13.3%,$40,87,,"Heavy and soft, with cherry and blackberry flavors that could almost be described as Rhône-style. Lacks delicacy and verve, but these mountain-grown wines can be deceptive in youth. Give it 5–6 years in the cellar, and try again."
Starfield 2018 The Miner's Inch Red (El Dorado),Starfield,Red,The Miner's Inch,"Red Blends, Red Blends","El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.9%,$28,90,Jim Gordon,This agile and complex wine emphasizes good balance and a tempting mélange of red-fruit flavors that are well braced by bright acidity and moderate tannins. The blend is more than half Cinsault plus four other grape varieties.
Encostas de Estremoz 2017 Bis Rosé (Alentejano),Encostas de Estremoz,Rose,Bis,Rosé,"Alentejano, Portugal",12.5%,$10,83,Roger Voss,"This is a fat and rather flabby rosé, dark in color and with a heavy feel. It has weighty red fruits and only light acidity."
Psagot 2011 Edom Red (Judean Hills),Psagot,Red,Edom,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Judean Hills, Israel",14.5%,$38,91,Mike DeSimone,"Aromas suggest blueberry, coffee and orange rind. The nice marriage of cooked and fresh fruit flavors with cool herbal notes includes blueberry, black cherry, anise, eucalyptus, coffee, pencil lead and violet. Tannins come on strong but back off appropriately, and the pleasing finish includes lasting touches of leather and tart cherry."
Daniel 2015 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Daniel,Red,Ferrington Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",13.3%,$60,95,Jim Gordon,"Savory nuances and a tight, nervy structure distinguish this impressive, potentially long-lived wine. It has all the ripe fruit and full body one could ask for, but also offers accents of sage, black tea and redwood forest in the aromas and meaty accents in the flavors. Great balance from good acidity and firm tannins completes the picture. Best after 2021."
Köster-Wolf 2003 Trocken 1 Liter Riesling (Rheinhessen),Köster-Wolf,White,Trocken 1 Liter,Riesling,"Rheinhessen, Germany",13%,$11,86,Joe Czerwinski,"A solid value in dry Riesling (keep in mind that the bottle is one-third larger than standard). The ripe apple scents lead into dry minerally flavors that boast rounded, smooth edges. Purists may gripe that it lacks a certain precision because of this, but others will find it more accessible and easier to drink for precisely the same reason. Imported by Chapin Cellars."
Macari 2007 Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),Macari,White,Reserve Barrel Fermented,Chardonnay,"North Fork of Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",13.5%,$23,85,Lauren Buzzeo,"With 12 months in French oak, the Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay is a rounder, more spice-infused Chard than Macari's regular Estate Bottled offering. As big as it is, the nose is somewhat muted with soft notes of pear and yellow flowers and the palate shows more as a result of the oak (spice, toast) than the fruit."
Tenuta del Buonamico 2015 Cercatoja Red (Toscana),Tenuta del Buonamico,Red,Cercatoja,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$33,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"This blend of Sangiovese, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon has aromas of black-skinned fruit, baking spice and cedar while the firm palate offers blackberry jam, clove and mocha. Solid tannins provide support."
Hogue 2001 Terroir Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),Hogue,Red,Terroir,Sangiovese,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$25,87,Paul Gregutt,"This limited-production (137 cases) wine is made primarily of Walla Walla Seven Hills Vineyard fruit, which lends a soft, pleasantly fruity cherry pie character. Four other red grapes are blended in, which gives it a generic red, rather than varietal, palate."
The Eyrie Vineyards 2018 Roland Green Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),The Eyrie Vineyards,Red,Roland Green,Pinot Noir,"Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13%,$65,94,Paul Gregutt,"Among the half dozen 2018 Pinots from Eyrie this is the tightest and least immediately expressive, which suggests decanting and/or aggressive aeration prior to early drinking. It grudgingly reveals strawberry and black cherry fruit with a spine of iron. The compact flavors and inner rigidity suggest that this should be cellared and could easily improve for a decade or longer. Drink 2026 to 2035."
André Kientzler 2015 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),André Kientzler,White,,"Gewürztraminer, Gewürztraminer","Alsace, Alsace, France",13.5%,$20,86,Anne Krebiehl MW,Ripe peach on the nose has some earthy undertones. The palate is fresh but has the same earthy and slightly muddy aspect. Lemon freshness brightens the flavors and creates subtle balance. Drink soon.
Bodegas Roda 2009 Sela  (Rioja),Bodegas Roda,Red,Sela,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$33,90,Michael Schachner,"Ripe from the beginning, with big berry aromas matched by sweet molasses and brown sugar aromas. Round, full and jammy in the mouth, with sweet berry flavors and notes of mild spices and vanilla. Long and just a bit oaky on the finish. Nice and approachable; drink now through 2013."
Olivier Leflaive 2014  Chevalier-Montrachet,Olivier Leflaive,White,,Chardonnay,"Chevalier-Montrachet, Burgundy, France",13%,$710,95,Roger Voss,"The wine comes from a small strip of a half acre in the center of this famed grand cru, part of the Olivier Leflaive family domaine. It is laden with toast flavors from the wood fermentation as well as intense fruit, green plums and crisp apples which are given extra richness by apricots. Concentrated and densely textured the wine will develop so well. Drink from 2022."
Charles Krug 2013 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),Charles Krug,Red,Estate Grown,Merlot,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.9%,$25,88,Virginie Boone,"Thick and chocolatey, this brawny wine is full bodied and richly concentrated. It is a mighty force of blackberry, blueberry and toasted oak."
Fujishin 2012 Mourvèdre,Fujishin,Red,,Mourvèdre,"Idaho, US",14.2%,$22,82,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is aromatically untoward, with notes of green herbs, bell pepper, dried tobacco and black pepper. The flavors are silky in feel and show decent concentration along with tart acids."
Domaine Nathalie & Gilles Fevre 2018 Vieilles Vignes  (Chablis),Domaine Nathalie & Gilles Fevre,White,Vieilles Vignes,Chardonnay,"Chablis, Burgundy, France",12.5%,$23,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Pear and lemon appear on the nose of this wine, alongside tantalizing notions suggesting citrus peel, bergamot and bitter orange. The palate bounds the 2018 generosity with that fragrant citrus zestiness, accompanied by crunchy firmness and a chalky texture. It has depth, originality and expressiveness."
La Tunella 2006 Campo Marzio Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli),La Tunella,White,Campo Marzio,"Friulano, Italian White","Colli Orientali del Friuli, Northeastern Italy, Italy",14%,$37,91,,"This is a slightly buttery blend of Friulano and Ribolla Gialla with gorgeous aromas of stone fruit, vanilla bean, honey and drying minerals. The wine boasts a thick, creamy consistency and beautiful fruit flavors capped by a playfully spicy finish. Wonderful."
Sebastopol 2002 Dutton Estate- Jewel Block Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Sebastopol,Red,Dutton Estate- Jewel Block Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$48,89,,"Full, ripe, rich and delicately structured, this lovely Pinot shows complex flavors of cherries, herbs, mocha and currant. Feels soft and elegant in the mouth, a finely textured wine with lots of spice in the finish."
Hawks View 2011 Chardonnay (Yamhill-Carlton),Hawks View,White,,Chardonnay,"Yamhill-Carlton, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.4%,$26,86,Paul Gregutt,"This is tight to the point of being shut down. Scents of skin phenolics suggest pear and apple fruit, but there's little flesh on these bones, and the wine stubbornly refuses to open up, even after several hours of breathing time."
Six Sigma Ranch 2007 Christian's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Lake County),Six Sigma Ranch,Red,Christian's Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Lake County, Lake County, California, US",13.9%,$45,87,,"Dark fruits characterize this young, vigorous wine. Black cherries, blackberries, even dark chocolate flood the palate, delicious and spicy. Yet there's a tannic, acidic tightness that makes the mouthfeel tough and gritty. One of the better Lake County Pinots out there, but work needs to be done."
Finca Antigua 2006 Blanco Viura (La Mancha),Finca Antigua,White,Blanco,"Viura, Spanish White","La Mancha, Central Spain, Spain",13%,$10,82,Michael Schachner,"Zingy and sort of floral on the nose, but fairly pickled, less than pure fruit mars the flavor profile. White wine from La Mancha has never been a Spanish strong suit, and while this wine isn't cloying, sharp or dead on arrival, it doesn't add up to much."
Brick House 2013 Cascadia Chardonnay (Ribbon Ridge),Brick House,White,Cascadia,Chardonnay,"Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.6%,$36,91,Paul Gregutt,"Here is a reserve-level wine that is a showcase for elegance rather than sheer power. Refined flavors of peach, pear and melon carry notes of cilantro and a finishing lick of Butter Brickle. Give this a little extra breathing time, or cellar till 2018."
:Nota Bene 2003 Syrah (Washington),:Nota Bene,Red,,,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$26,88,Paul Gregutt,"It's an interesting experiment—basically a Syrah-dominated Bordeaux blend—but it does not entirely knit together. The Syrah is up front, toasty and peppery, and the Bordeaux grapes lay back, adding weight to the tannins and a sense, more than a flavor, of herb. But there's a disconnect between the two components. As with previous vintages, this wine opens with breathing time, adding smoke and spice to the finish."
Meran 2014 Festival Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),Meran,White,Festival,Pinot Grigio,"Alto Adige, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13%,$17,87,Kerin O’Keefe,Aromas of green apple and white peach lead the nose and follow through to the zesty palate along with notes of pear and candied lemon peel. Lively acidity gives it a crisp finish.
La Togata 2017  Rosso di Montalcino,La Togata,Red,,Sangiovese,"Rosso di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$28,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"Subdued aromas of leather, tilled soil and dark-skinned fruit emerge from the glass. The no-frills palate offers clove and black plum. Drink soon."
Dão Sul 2011 Quinta de Lourosa White (Vinho Verde),Dão Sul,White,Quinta de Lourosa,Portuguese White,"Vinho Verde, Portugal",11%,$8,88,Roger Voss,"This is a bone-dry, piercingly fresh wine. It has tense acidity and a mineral texture that would make it delicious as an accompaniment to seafood. The wine is crisp, refreshing and bright."
Segura Viudas NV Aria Pinot Noir Brut Sparkling (Cava),Segura Viudas,Sparkling,Aria Pinot Noir Brut,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Cava, Catalonia, Spain",12%,$14,86,Michael Schachner,"With a rusty salmon color, this Pinot Noir Cava offers citrus and red-fruit aromas along with earthy funk. The palate is generally well balanced, while smoky, earthy flavors of red fruits and citrus finish mild."
Maximin Grünhäuser 2017 Abtsberg Superior Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel),Maximin Grünhäuser,White,Abtsberg Superior Grosse Lage,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",11.5%,$64,93,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This zesty, penetrating Riesling is sourced from low-yielding grapes in the best parcels of the producer's legendary Abtsberg vineyards. It's intensely smoky and earthen on the nose but boasts tart tangerine and lemon flavors glazed with honey and steel. A complex, captivating wine that's lovely already but will likely improve through 2030."
Gamble Family Vineyards 2016 Mary Ann Red (Mount Veeder),Gamble Family Vineyards,Red,Mary Ann,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Mount Veeder, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$185,93,Virginie Boone,"A blend of 54% Cabernet Franc with 35% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Sauvignon, creates a rare time for Cab Franc to shine.This mountain wine is structured, spicy and soft on the palate in well-integrated tannin. Dark mocha, tobacco, sage and toasted oak play along a robustly balanced core of elegant intensity."
Santa Maria La Palma 2008 Aragosta  (Vermentino di Sardegna),Santa Maria La Palma,White,Aragosta,"Vermentino, Italian White","Vermentino di Sardegna, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",12%,$12,85,,"Aromas of pine and dried herbs emerge from the nose of this light and luminous Vermentino from Sardinia. The wine also boasts fruit nuances of citrus, peach and green fruit."
Concha y Toro 2013 Amelia Limited Release Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),Concha y Toro,White,Amelia Limited Release,Chardonnay,"Casablanca Valley, Chile",14%,,86,Michael Schachner,"Popcorn, mustard, pickle brine and a heavy blast of oak create a barrel-driven bouquet. This is acidic and juicy on the palate, but also resiny. Flavors of briny citrus, nectarine and raw oak finish long and woody, with a cidery aftertaste."
Tenuta di Riseccoli 1999  Chianti Classico,Tenuta di Riseccoli,Red,,Sangiovese,"Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$12,89,Michael Schachner,"Attractive in the nose, with typical and traditional aromas of cherry and underbrush. Mild oak adds some vanilla to the cherry-laden palate, which also offers a fine touch of cinnamon. The finish is round and modestly tannic. All in all this one comes real close to the bull's eye. It's solid and largely complete. Best Buy. —M.S."
Evening Land 2010 Seven Springs Vineyard La Source Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),Evening Land,Red,Seven Springs Vineyard La Source,Pinot Noir,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.1%,$60,95,Paul Gregutt,"In a stellar lineup of 2010 Evening Land Pinots, this is the best. It displays eye-popping character and depth, a ripe powerhouse at just 13.1% alcohol. Black cherry fruit comes laced with cinnamon and baking spice notes. It's a full, round, rich, and fruity wine that just never quits."
Casa Santos Lima 2018 Bona Vita Red (Lisboa),Casa Santos Lima,Red,Bona Vita,Portuguese Red,"Lisboa, Portugal",14%,$10,85,Roger Voss,"Ripe black fruits and light tannins are a mark of this already attractive wine. It is balanced, with plenty of acidity at the end. Drink now"
Coronica 2012 Malvasia (Istria),Coronica,White,,"Malvasia, Italian White",,13.3%,$20,88,Jeff Jenssen,"Salt air, lemon pith and lemon blossom lead in this 100% Malvasia Istriana. A wave of citrus and pronounced juicy grapefruit flavors refreshes the midpalate. The finish is zesty and lively."
Talbott 2012 Diamond T Vineyard Chardonnay (Monterey),Talbott,White,Diamond T Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Monterey, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$52,91,Matt Kettmann,"From a vineyard planted in 1982 at 1,200 feet above the Carmel Valley, this wine offers a nose that is nothing short of fascinating. Oak smoke, yellow cake and cinnamon stick are followed by sharper, dill-like herbs, then the scents of the shoreline. The palate sprinkles toasted wood atop lemon peels and apple skins, proving sour, bitter and elegantly restrained yet flavorful."
Tenuta di Biserno 2007 Il Pino di Biserno Red (Toscana),Tenuta di Biserno,Red,Il Pino di Biserno,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$80,93,,"From Marchese Lodovico Antinori's beautiful wine estate in Bibbona, this boasts the heritage of the great super Tuscan family to which it belongs. The blend is Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, and the overall effect is simply gorgeous. Richness, generosity and persistence characterize the mouthfeel, and the bouquet is driven by aromas of red cherry, chocolate and spice. Drink after 2015."
Maycas del Limari 2006 Reserva Especial Chardonnay (Limarí Valley),Maycas del Limari,White,Reserva Especial,Chardonnay,"Limarí Valley, Chile",14%,$20,88,Michael Schachner,"Concha y Toro's new foray into northerly Limarí has resulted in a new line of wines called Maycas. This wine shows a combination of tropical and coastal characteristics. On one hand, there's banana and pineapple flavors; on the other there's peach and apple. And there's definitely a coastal ring to the wine's mouthfeel: it's racy, crisp and a little bit jumpy."
Township 7 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Okanagan Valley),Township 7,White,Reserve,Chardonnay,,13.3%,$18,89,Paul Gregutt,"This blends Dijon clones 76 and 96, and is partially barrel fermented. The spicy nose sharpens the palate with pine needle aromas, and the flavors follow. It's a precise wine, showing pine and mineral more than fruit."
Galil Mountain 2007 Kosher Shiraz (Galilee),Galil Mountain,Red,Kosher,,"Galilee, Israel",15%,$15,86,Lauren Buzzeo,"Prominent menthol aromas hit you first in the bouquet of this wine, followed closely by bright red cherry and pepper accents. More of the same unfolds on the palate, with accents of raspberry sauce and mocha developing on the finish. Lighter weight with delicate tannins; very drinkable and enjoyable."
Redwood 2004 Select Series Barbera (California),Redwood,Red,Select Series,Barbera,"California, California Other, California, US",13.5%,$10,83,,"So what do you get in a $10 Barbera? Just what you'd expect: a bone-dry, high-acid wine, with Barbera's furry grapeskin tannins and flavors of black- and purple-skinned fruits."
Casa do Valle 2015 Reserva Special Edition White (Vinho Verde),Casa do Valle,White,Reserva Special Edition,Portuguese White,"Vinho Verde, Portugal",13.5%,$40,92,Roger Voss,"The blend of this rich wine is dominated by Alvarinho, some of it from old vines. With its wonderful ripe fruit and layers of apricot and pear flavors, this is like no other Vinho Verde. That is except for that zingy acidity that gives the wine is refreshing fruitiness at the end. Drink now."
Castello di Monsanto 2011 Il Poggio Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Castello di Monsanto,Red,Il Poggio Riserva,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$55,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of underbrush, dark-skinned berry, espresso menthol and scorched soil lead the nose. On the elegant, structured palate, firm, polished tannins carry dried black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon toast and a touch of anise. Drink 2017–2023."
Burrowing Owl 2013 Athene Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Okanagan Valley),Burrowing Owl,Red,Athene,,,14.5%,$40,88,Paul Gregutt,"This is 48% Cabernet Sauvignon and 52% Syrah, which seems to be the dominant grape in terms of flavor and style. Scents and flavors of char, licorice and espresso come up quickly, with black fruit showing a peppery edge. The finish seems attenuated, even with ample aeration."
González Byass NV Nectar Dulce Pedro Ximénez (Jerez),González Byass,Port/Sherry,Nectar Dulce,"Pedro Ximénez, Sherry","Jerez, Andalucia, Spain",15.5%,$18,91,Michael Schachner,"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on. Impressive depth of flavor, nice overall balance and a mix of complexity and flat-out richness make this PX a winner."
La Diacceta 2000 Vernaccia (San Gimignano),La Diacceta,White,,"Vernaccia, Italian White","San Gimignano, Tuscany, Italy",,$11,87,Michael Schachner,"The bouquet of white peach and wet stones is fresh as can be. There's a rich texture to the palate, with flavors of cinnamon and spice accenting ripe pear. Finishes long and fairly full with some banana flavor."
Maryhill 2009 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Maryhill,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.6%,$17,86,Paul Gregutt,"Spice, pepper, chocolate and a hint of stem are all wrapped into this light-hearted Cabernet Franc. The pretty, sweet, cherry candy core gives it immediate appeal. Drink up."
Staglin 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Staglin,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rutherford, Napa, California, US",14.9%,$175,96,,"A big wine, rather ponderous now in the size and forwardness of its fruit and the volume of mainly new French oak. The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance. Best 2013–2019, at least."
Abad Dom Bueno 2008 Mencía (Bierzo),Abad Dom Bueno,Red,,"Mencía, Spanish Red","Bierzo, Northern Spain, Spain",13.8%,$26,91,Michael Schachner,"A potent Mencía with concentrated berry aromas along with intense oak, rubber and graphite notes. Full-bodied and sound as a boulder, with balance, tannic grip and rousing flavors of black cherry, blackberry and dark spices. Toasty and black on the finish; top-shelf Bierzo to drink now through 2015."
Deutz 2008 Amour de Deutz Brut  (Champagne),Deutz,Sparkling,Amour de Deutz Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$93,95,Roger Voss,"This wine is rich and surprisingly full-bodied. It comes from a great Champagne vintage, giving it both intensity and an acidity built for longterm aging. This half-bottle version is filling out, showing almond flavors yet retaining its citrus edge. Drink from 2019."
Benegas 2009 Clara Benegas Chardonnay-Sauvignon (Mendoza),Benegas,White,Clara Benegas,"Chardonnay-Sauvignon, White Blend","Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13%,$14,84,Michael Schachner,"Smells both nutty and warm as well as citric and sharp. The palate keeps that pace; it's citrusy and cidery in feel, with orange, banana and spice flavors. Finishes quick and a little heavy. 70% Chardonnay and 30% Sauvignon Blanc."
Napa Station 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Napa Station,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.4%,$28,86,,"A good everyday Cab, soft and ripe, with berry-cherry, oak and spice flavors. Full-bodied and dry, with fine tannins, it's at its best now."
Corte Pavone 2015 Campo Marzio  (Brunello di Montalcino),Corte Pavone,Red,Campo Marzio,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",15.5%,$80,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Weedy underbrush, stewed prune and leather aromas slowly come together along with a whiff of blue flower. The dense, rather lethargic palate reflects the heat of the vintage, offering raisin, tobacco and the heat of evident alcohol but it lacks vitality and fruit richness. Close-grained tannins provide support and generate a rather astringent finish."
Colinas do Douro 2015 Superior White (Douro),Colinas do Douro,White,Superior,Portuguese White,"Douro, Portugal",13%,$15,88,Roger Voss,"Grown at 1,800 feet, the vines for this wine benefit from the cool conditions needed to develop aromatic intensity. With crisp acidity combined with spiced pear and nutmeg flavors, it's both tightly textured and very fruity. Drink now."
Folie à Deux 1997 Bowman Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),Folie à Deux,Red,Bowman Vineyard,Zinfandel,"Amador County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",,$24,88,,"An initially closed nose gives way to cinnamon and coffee notes. Sweet fruit, including strawberries. Good acidity, juicy and big, there are nice drying tannins on the finish. An interesting wine typical of Amador County."
Highway 12 2012 Serres Ranch Red (Sonoma Valley),Highway 12,Red,Serres Ranch,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.3%,$28,87,Virginie Boone,"Nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine is perfumed in lavender and awash in juicy red cassis. The acidity is medium to high, while the tannins are rough and chewy, suggesting the need for assimilation time."
Atwater 2017 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),Atwater,White,,,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12.2%,$18,85,Alexander Peartree,"Faint aromas of pear and melon carry the nose. The palate is more explosive in nature, driven by tangy green apple and racy acidity that never relents. This is supertart and brisk."
Château Canon la Gaffelière 2005  Saint-Émilion,Château Canon la Gaffelière,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,94,Roger Voss,"A successful wine from Canon la Gaffelière. It is in a modern style with very polished edges of fruit, but the heart of the wine has a core of solid, dark, dry tannins. The wood gives spiciness, but it is the black, juicy fruits that impress."
Cascina La Ghersa 1999 Camparo  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),Cascina La Ghersa,Red,Camparo,Barbera,"Barbera d'Asti Superiore, Piedmont, Italy",13.5%,$14,88,Michael Schachner,"Chunky red plum aromas get this one cooking, and there is plenty more plum and cherry backing up the lively bouquet. The finish is clean, if a bit basic. Overall it's a tight, structured, textbook modern Barbera, one that'll be ideal at the dinner table."
Standing Stone 2008 Merlot (Finger Lakes),Standing Stone,Red,,Merlot,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",13%,$20,82,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Cherry and menthol meld with whiffs of forest floor and bramble on this dry, medium bodied Merlot. The palate is pleasant with black fruit and a rustic fall foliage character, but the finish falls short with a hint of bitterness at the end."
Masottina NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),Masottina,Sparkling,Extra Dry,"Glera, Italian White","Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore, Veneto, Italy",11.5%,$26,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"This bright, creamy sparkler offers delicate aromas and flavors of fragrant spring flowers, white peach, green apple and citrus. The rich flavors are brightened by brisk acidity while a foaming mousse adds finesse."
Ruta 22 2013 Malbec (Mendoza),Ruta 22,Red,,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$13,87,Michael Schachner,"Rubbery slightly grassy berry and plum aromas give way to a fresh and fair palate that works. Oaky cherry and berry flavors are standard but well presented, while the finish is mild, with leftover plum and berry notes."
The Audition 2015 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),The Audition,Red,,Zinfandel,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15.5%,$35,85,Virginie Boone,"This burly, ripe wine tastes of chocolate-covered raisin, baked plum, cinnamon and a tease of prune, its body weight substantial and soft. Dusty, earthy elements and toasted oak round out the picture."
Merry Edwards 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Merry Edwards,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$36,91,,"Acidity marks this ripe, delicious wine, giving it a tartness that works to balance the extraordinarily ripe flavors. Cherries, black raspberries, mulberries and pomegranates all mingle together, with spice and cedar complications, and the finish is totally dry and somewhat tannic. Great now, and should hold for a good six years."
Niepoort 2015 Bioma Vintage Vinha Velha  (Port),Niepoort,Port/Sherry,Bioma Vintage Vinha Velha,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,,90,Roger Voss,Concentrated black currant jelly aromas lead on the powerful nose. The tannins are concentrated although the intensely perfumed character of the fruit is likely to be delicious. Acidity at the end balances this over-the-top wine.
Bodega Zafado 2015 Chardonnay (Mendoza),Bodega Zafado,White,,Chardonnay,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.9%,$14,83,Michael Schachner,"Resiny oak sticks out, while the palate is grabby and sticky in feel. This tastes like lemony pushcart hotdogs and the briny water they sit in, followed by a woody, low-fruit finish."
Shannon Ridge 2018 High Elevation Collection Chardonnay (Lake County),Shannon Ridge,White,High Elevation Collection,Chardonnay,"Lake County, Lake County, California, US",13.8%,$23,90,Jim Gordon,"Nicely balanced and layered, this medium-bodied wine wraps good, snappy lemon and tempting vanilla flavors in lively acidity. It's nervy and rather rich at the same time, which is a tasty combination."
Vigneti Repetto 2018 Derthona Quadro Timorasso (Colli Tortonesi),Vigneti Repetto,White,Derthona Quadro,"Timorasso, Italian White","Colli Tortonesi, Piedmont, Italy",13.5%,$34,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of camphor, yellow field flowers and hazelnut form the nose along with a whiff of botanical herbs. The linear, medium-bodied palate features ripe apricot, pear, lemon and saline notes before an almond close. Bright acidity keeps it fresh and balanced."
Quivira 2016 Black Boar Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),Quivira,Red,Black Boar,Zinfandel,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.9%,VivinoGary's Wine,92,Virginie Boone,"This is a juicy, leathery and layered wine with hearty characteristics of grilled meat, blackberry and black cherry. Bold and full bodied, it retains supportive acidity and is integrated in tannin and oak, showing lasting notes of nutmeg and clove."
Adega Cooperativa Ponte de Lima 2009 Colheita Seleccionada Loureiro (Vinho Verde),Adega Cooperativa Ponte de Lima,White,Colheita Seleccionada,"Loureiro, Portuguese White","Vinho Verde, Portugal",11%,,90,Roger Voss,"Loureiro has made the region of Ponte de Lima its home, and this full and rich wine brings together the crispness with a more serious perfumed character. It is a wine that could age for a year, although its extreme vibrant fruit is already in great form."
Fenestra 2003 Silvaspoons Vineyard Tempranillo (Lodi),Fenestra,Red,Silvaspoons Vineyard,Tempranillo,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",13.4%,$19,85,,"Take a wine with Pinot Noir's delicate, silky texture and cross it with Zinfandel's robust, rustic quality, and you get this Temp. It's dry and easy in the mouth, with cherry and Kahlua flavors and lots of anise and nutmeg."
Buena Vista 2008 The Count Founder's Red (Sonoma County),Buena Vista,Red,The Count Founder's,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",,$20,87,,"All of the charms of this Merlot, Syrah and Zinfandel blend are on the surface, but what a pretty surface it is. Polished raspberry and cherry fruit, bacon, cream and a splendid array of flashy spices characterize the flavors."
Armanino Family Cellars 2011 The Ringneck Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Armanino Family Cellars,Red,The Ringneck,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.6%,$55,92,,"A distinguished Pinot Noir that shows its coastal origins in brisk tannins and citrusy acidity. Beneath the astringency and tartness are impressive cherry, currant, cola, sweet tobacco and sandalwood flavors that finish with great complexity and style. Certainly seems like a wine for the cellar. Your window of drinkability is 2015–2019."
Frequency 2015 G-S-M (Santa Barbara County),Frequency,Red,,"G-S-M, Rhône-style Red Blend","Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",14.7%,$32,92,Matt Kettmann,"There is a strong garrigue character to the nose of this blend of 50% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre, with dried thyme, dill and black pepper spicing up the damson and crushed slate aromas. The palate shows that the wine is still very young, but the herbally lifted flavors of black-pepper dust and boysenberry ensure great things to come."
Chacabuco 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Chacabuco,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$9,84,Michael Schachner,"Candied oak creates cinnamon aromas that are not offensive but seem forced and false. A grabby palate is sticky and more tannic than you might expect, while herbal, candied berry flavors control the finish."
Theopolis 2016 Symphony (Yorkville Highlands),Theopolis,White,,"Symphony, Other White","Yorkville Highlands, North Coast, California, US",12.8%,$22,87,Jim Gordon,Strong floral honeyed aromas and robust grapy flavors give this dry wine a big personality despite its light body. Lively acidity and a hint of tannin make the texture grippy.
Belle Glos 2017 Las Alturas Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Belle Glos,Red,Las Alturas,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.8%,,90,Matt Kettmann,"Very dark in the glass, this is rich, heady wine that offers powerfully hedonistic flavors yet does not retain much Pinot Noir-ness. Strong aromas of oak, black cherry, cola and caramel lead into a thick palate of berry paste, root beer and crème brûlée."
Channing Daughters 2014 Rosato (Long Island),Channing Daughters,Rose,,"Rosato, Rosé","Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",13%,$20,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This dry Merlot rosé is the benchmark from which to compare each of Channing Daughter's seven rosato wines this vintage. It's elegantly framed, perfumed with waxy-white florals and crisp strawberry and cherry notes. Dry and crisp, yet luscious in body with a lingering touch of bramble on the finish."
Bodegas Caro 2005 Amancaya Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Bodegas Caro,Red,Amancaya,"Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$20,88,Michael Schachner,"From the Catena-Rothschild partnership that is Bodegas Caro, Amancaya blends Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon in an appealing way. The nose is a touch bretty and rustic, but airing reveals stout fruit and structure. The flavor profile revolves around ripe plum and berry, while coffee and a touch of heat and alcohol work the finish. Another year in bottle would not hurt this wine."
Copia 2016 The Pope Grenache (Paso Robles),Copia,Red,The Pope,Grenache,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15.3%,$48,91,Matt Kettmann,"Crème brûlée, black-cherry, concentrated rosewater, potpourri and wet earth aromas make for a complex nose on this bottling. It's explosive on the palate with boysenberry and dark-cranberry flavors, lifted by stemmy hints of dried herb and composting leaves."
Elena Fucci 2017 Titolo  (Aglianico del Vulture),Elena Fucci,Red,Titolo,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Aglianico del Vulture, Southern Italy, Italy",14%,$45,92,Alexander Peartree,"Aromas of spiced bramble berries, violet and slightly singed resinous herbs carry the nose and echo on the palate. Juicy fruit fills it all out, with a slick of granite lending a zesty mineral twang. There's real drive and energy to it all, with cherry skins lingering on the close. Drink through 2030."
Gorman 2016 Zachary's Ladder Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Gorman,Red,Zachary's Ladder,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",15.5%,$30,87,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (80%), with the balance Syrah (15%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of dried herb, flower and slightly dried out cherry are followed by lighter-styled fruit flavors that have a slightly candied, dried-out note. The concentration doesn't all seem to be there."
Tenuta Rocca 2006 San Pietro  (Barolo),Tenuta Rocca,Red,San Pietro,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$60,93,,"San Pietro is a beautifully perfumed Barolo with delicate tones of blue flowers, violets, licorice, crushed mineral, cola and forest berry. The floral nuances transfer to the mouth, adding to the wine's overall persistency and complexity. Hold five more years."
Ferraud et Fils 2013 Les Merrains  (Beaujolais-Villages),Ferraud et Fils,Red,Les Merrains,Gamay,"Beaujolais-Villages, Beaujolais, France",,,85,Roger Voss,"This is a soft and perfumed wine, the red fruits hanging out easily with the acidity and gentle structure. It has a juicy character, hints of banana in the background and a fruity aftertaste."
Albino Armani 2017  Lugana,Albino Armani,White,,"Turbiana, Italian White","Lugana, Lombardy, Italy",14%,,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Round and enveloping, this opens with aromas of mature orchard fruit and pressed wild flower. The fruity palate doles out juicy white peach and candied lemon drop alongside a hint of almond liqueur."
Daniel Crochet 2018 Rosé (Sancerre),Daniel Crochet,Rose,,Rosé,"Sancerre, Loire Valley, France",15.5%,$29,84,Roger Voss,"The high alcohol of this wine shows on the palate, with a pepperiness that smothers the attractive red fruits. Drink now."
Don Bernardino 2013 Godello (Valdeorras),Don Bernardino,White,,"Godello, Spanish White","Valdeorras, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$17,83,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it. The palate is round but oily in feel, while flavors of saline water, pithy citrus and bitter melon finish peppery and soft, with low acidity."
Balgownie Estate 2002 Shiraz (Bendigo),Balgownie Estate,Red,,,"Bendigo, Victoria, Australia",14.5%,$30,89,,"Right out of the bottle, this wine brims with blackberry and cassis aromas and flavors, but with air, it takes on more earthy, briary—even nutty, as is the case with the nose—notes. Has a chalky feel and medium body; restrained and food friendly. Imported by Old Bridge Cellars."
Andreola Orsola NV Dirupo Brut  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),Andreola Orsola,Sparkling,Dirupo Brut,"Prosecco, Sparkling","Prosecco di Valdobbiadene, Veneto, Italy",11%,$16,87,,"Here is a luminous single-vineyard bubbly with steady and persistent perlage and pristine aromas of acacia flower, orange zest and peach. Thanks to small percentages of Verdiso and Perera, it is a very fruit-forward wine with great balance and drying mineral tones."
Ruta 22 2012 Malbec (Patagonia),Ruta 22,Red,,Malbec,"Patagonia, Other, Argentina",14.5%,$13,86,Michael Schachner,"Red-fruit aromas of plum and berry are earthy and a bit stalky. The palate is tight, narrow and crisp more than flush. Spice, a touch of green herbs and then raspberry and plum flavors finish herbal, spicy and drying in feel."
Wrights Station 2012 Cave Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),Wrights Station,Red,Cave Block Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Santa Cruz Mountains, Central Coast, California, US",14.6%,$49,92,Matt Kettmann,"From a winery named after a summit train stop between Los Gatos and Santa Cruz comes aromas of red cherry, rhubarb and clove spice. Flavors of vanilla cookies, dried strawberries, black cherries and a spicy dollop of licorice power the tasty palate."
Quinta de Baixo 2005 Grande Escolha Red (Bairrada),Quinta de Baixo,Red,Grande Escolha,Portuguese Red,"Bairrada, Portugal",14%,$35,87,Roger Voss,"The extra years before release of this wine have certainly enabled it to develop some mature, smooth wood and ripe fruit characters. It has firm tannins, certainly, while giving the black currant fruit flavors a great chance to shine."
Northwest Ridge 2019 8 Barrel Whole Cluster Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Northwest Ridge,Red,8 Barrel Whole Cluster,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.8%,$25,87,Paul Gregutt,"This is aggressively astringent, with an immediate sensation of green tea, green herbs and tongue-drying tannins. The fruit flavors are muted, wild and thin. There's a touch of cannabis in the flavors, which harks back to much earlier days of Oregon Pinot Noir."
Tenuta Oliveto 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,Tenuta Oliveto,Red,,"Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese","Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",,$90,90,,"This beautiful estate near Castelnuovo dell'Abate is only about ten years old and the vines seemed to have reached harmony in 2004 (2003 produced a jammy wine). Aromas recall black berry fruit, ripe cherry, coffee and chocolate. Happily with this vintage, the ripeness of the fruit plays into the overall intensity of the wine."
Les Rocailles NV Caprice des Rocailles Gamay (Savoie),Les Rocailles,Sparkling,Caprice des Rocailles,Gamay,"Savoie, France Other, France",8%,$22,86,Roger Voss,"Lightly pink in color, this sweet sparkling wine is full of ripe strawberry fruit. And with its low alcohol, it's the perfect pairing for strawberries and cream. Acidity keeps it in balance."
Noceto 2015 Misto Sangiovese (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),Noceto,Red,Misto,Sangiovese,"Shenandoah Valley (CA), Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.5%,$32,89,Jim Gordon,"A beefy brothy aroma leads to rich concentrated fruit flavors in this full-bodied and firm-textured wine. It has good structure, tasty layers of black cherry and red cherry and a mouth-filling presence that's appealing."
Iby 2011 Chevalier Blaufränkisch (Mittelburgenland),Iby,Red,Chevalier,"Blaufränkisch, Other Red","Mittelburgenland, Austria",13.5%,$35,91,Anne Krebiehl MW,"If you expect coquettish flirting you must go elsewhere: this amply layered red will not give up its secrets easily. But engage with it and it will reward with poised, polished structure, subtle pepper spice and ripe but reined-in cherry fruit. The more time you spend with it, the more you'll discover. Ready from 2015."
Ledson 2004 Baldoochi Old Vine Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Ledson,Red,Baldoochi Old Vine,Zinfandel,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.9%,$36,87,,"There's more than a little residual sugar in this soft, sensual Zin, but the wine handles its sweetness well. It's terrifically ripe in blackberry, mulberry, boysenberry and other rustic berry flavors, with lots of spices and vanilla. Drink now."
Conterno Fantino 2014 Sorì Ginestra  (Barolo),Conterno Fantino,Red,Sorì Ginestra,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$115,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of dark-skinned fruit. The taut palate offers sour cherry, vanilla and mocha alongside grippy tannins."
Borra 2006 47.5 Red (Lodi),Borra,Red,47.5,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",14.9%,$35,84,,"Mainly Petite Sirah, this wine has a hot, baked taste, like cherry pie filling that burbled out of the crust and got burnt and caramelized in the oven. Drink now."
Domaine Famille Lignères 2002 Notre Dame Syrah (Corbières),Domaine Famille Lignères,Red,Notre Dame,,"Corbières, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",,$30,90,,"This is the 100% Syrah cuvée, and it shows powerful varietal character in its smoky, peppery, meaty aromas and flavors. Despite a slightly creamy texture, it doesn't come across as heavy or overbearing."
Ponzi 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Ponzi,White,Reserve,Chardonnay,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$30,89,Paul Gregutt,"This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more. Crisp and detailed, this offers a classy mix of citrus and apple, wet stone and light baking spices. Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish."
Villa Canestrari 2004 I Lasi  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso),Villa Canestrari,Red,I Lasi,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara, Italian Red","Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso, Veneto, Italy",13.5%,,84,,"The nose here is slightly muddled and the purity of the fruit and spice are hard to distinguish overall. You will encounter brief cherry flavors and the wine imparts a gritty, raw texture."
Lanner Hill 2014 Cape Winemakers Guild Double Barrel Semillon (Darling),Lanner Hill,White,Cape Winemakers Guild Double Barrel,"Sémillon, Sémillon","Darling, South Africa",13.1%,,90,Lauren Buzzeo,"Winemaker: Nicky Versfeld. This Sémillon leads with surprisingly herbal notes of fynbos, orange blossom and lime leaf that leave the fruity tones of white melon, grapefruit peel and white plum. Despite the oak-derived notes of buttered toast, baking spice and toasted nuts, it boasts ample acidity and a slightly tart, astringent finish. Drink now–2019."
Morgante 2012 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),Morgante,Red,,"Nero d'Avola, Italian Red","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",14.5%,$18,88,Kerin O’Keefe,Here's a straightforward and fruity Nero d'Avola that offers delicious blackberry and black cherry flavors that are accented by a hint of Mediterranean herbs. The ripe palate is brightened by just enough fresh acidity.
Jean-Luc Colombo 2004 Les Ruchets  (Cornas),Jean-Luc Colombo,Red,Les Ruchets,,"Cornas, Rhône Valley, France",,$88,92,Joe Czerwinski,"Toastier, with cedary components and dark flavors of espresso and black olive. This is very firm, dense and muscular—the essence of concentrated Cornas opening with air to show more floral notes. Hold 10 years or more."
Lionel Osmin & Cie 2017 Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Buzet),Lionel Osmin & Cie,Red,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Buzet, Southwest France, France",14.5%,$12,88,Roger Voss,"This wine comes from a small enclave of vines halfway between Bordeaux and Toulouse. Its blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot gives an attractive ripe fruitiness, with black-currant flavors and plenty of acidity. Drink the wine now."
Barton 2014 The Broken Road Clare Ranch Viognier (Templeton Gap District),Barton,White,The Broken Road Clare Ranch,Viognier,"Templeton Gap District, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$24,88,Matt Kettmann,"Freshly squeezed peaches, peach custard and ripe melon make for a rich nose on this bottling, but they remain balanced and light rather than treacly. Yellow peach, apple custard and cherimoya fruit show on the palate, where a lime peel edge cuts through the touch of browned marshmallow."
Buena Vista 2004 Syrah (Carneros),Buena Vista,Red,,,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",,$25,86,,"Straightforward, uncomplicated but varietally correct, this wine features the bright blueberry and plum notes of Syrah, accented by hints of dried spices and vanilla. Ample in weight, supple in the mouth, but needs a bit more complexity and length to score higher."
Foppiano 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Foppiano,Red,Estate,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$35,84,Virginie Boone,"This wine has an abundance of baked-plum flavor wrapped in smoky char. A full-bodied, ripe expression of the grape, it delivers straightforward structure and an unfussy finish."
Spring Valley Vineyard 2008 Uriah Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Spring Valley Vineyard,Red,Uriah,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.9%,$50,88,Paul Gregutt,"The Merlot-based Uriah includes 36% Cabernet Franc, 8% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec from the estate vineyards. Perhaps due to its youth, the wine has a bit too much heat and sharpness for its fruit. Spring Valley seems to be sacrificing terroir for sheer power. It's plenty ripe, but the fruit flavors are blocky, with noticeable volatility."
Casa de la Ermita 2013 Joven Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla),Casa de la Ermita,Red,Joven,,"Jumilla, Levante, Spain",14%,$11,87,Michael Schachner,"This is a touch stalky and leathery up front, with animal and wild berry scents. Choppy acidity makes for a perky mouthfeel, while rustic, leathery flavors of baked plum finish earthy, oaky and a touch salty."
Viña Las Perdices 2007 Malbec (Mendoza),Viña Las Perdices,Red,,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$13,83,Michael Schachner,"Firm raspberry and cherry aromas, but nothing more, and then a tight, tough palate with syrupy, baked berry flavors and molasses. Turns mildly buttery on the finish, and always does it seem on the sweet and sticky side."
Château Clerc Milon 2015  Pauillac,Château Clerc Milon,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France",14%,,95,Roger Voss,"Densely structured and firm, this wine has weight, rich black fruits and great concentration. The tannins are still considerable, with obvious potential. This estate is now on top form. Drink this impressive wine from 2026."
Kadesh Barnea 2006 Estate Bottled Kosher Cabernet Sauvignon (Negev Hills),Kadesh Barnea,Red,Estate Bottled Kosher,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Negev Hills, Israel",14%,$19,83,Lauren Buzzeo,"The nose starts off a touch volatile with aromas of acetone. After that blows off, herbal notes of thyme and sage emerge supported by caramelized red fruit and berries. Sweet spiced red cherry and raspberry compote unfold in the mouth, leading into a medium-length finish."
Flora Springs 2001 Wild Boar Wineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Flora Springs,Red,Wild Boar Wineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$85,91,,"A study in balance from the warm Pope Valley region. Shows flamboyant blackberry and chocolate fruit, but has a masculine, firm edge from the tannins and acids, and is also well oaked. In fact, those tannins are big enough to age it for a decade or more."
Canalicchio di Sopra 2014  Rosso di Montalcino,Canalicchio di Sopra,Red,,Sangiovese,"Rosso di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$30,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Enticing scents of red berry, white pepper, chopped herb and purple flower take center stage on this vibrant red. The luminous palate doles out tart cherry, crushed raspberry and a hint of star anise while racy acidity and polished tannins provide support. Drink through 2017."
Chateau Ste. Michelle 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Chateau Ste. Michelle,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13%,VivinoWine.com,88,Paul Gregutt,"Another fine vintage for the widely available Columbia Valley Sauvignon Blanc from Ste. Michelle. This tangy bottle of ripe fruit has juicy, fleshy citrus, grapefruit and green apple flavors. Done in 80% stainless steel, with no discernable malolactic, gives a wine with plenty of acid and a lip-smacking finish."
Staete Landt 2006 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),Staete Landt,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Marlborough, New Zealand",14%,$35,88,Joe Czerwinski,
Siduri 2017 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Siduri,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$35,90,Virginie Boone,"Juicy black and red fruit highlight a weighty, full-bodied and fruit-forward style of powerful flavor in this well-made appellation wine. Baking spice and cola round out the profile."
Domaine Luquet 2011 Vers les Monts  (Saint-Véran),Domaine Luquet,White,Vers les Monts,Chardonnay,"Saint-Véran, Burgundy, France",13%,$17,85,Roger Voss,"This selection is fruity and refreshing, yet it has a full body and a ripe character. Taut and tangy on the finish, this wine can age for another 6–9 months to allow the structure to soften."
Herdade do Esporão 2004 Private Selection Garrafeira Red (Alentejo),Herdade do Esporão,Red,Private Selection Garrafeira,Portuguese Red,"Alentejo, Portugal",14.5%,$50,91,Roger Voss,"A powerful, rich wine, with a dense, ripe tannic mouthfeel. The structure is all about tamed opulence—it is a generous wine, with its black plum, cherry and spice flavors and acidity that gives the whole wine, despite its richness, a great lift."
Robert Oatley 2016 Finisterre Chardonnay (Margaret River),Robert Oatley,White,Finisterre,Chardonnay,"Margaret River, Western Australia, Australia",12.5%,$30,90,Christina Pickard,"Complexity and longevity are the name of the game here. This shows a restrained nose of melon, smoke, nuts and a little buttery oak. The palate is really where it's at, weaving those same flavors seamlessly together. With a chalky texture and a good lick of acidity, everything is in balance here, setting this wine up for plenty of years of life. Drink now–2025."
Terra d'Oro 2017 Barbera (Amador County),Terra d'Oro,Red,,Barbera,"Amador County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.5%,$18,91,Jim Gordon,"This full-bodied wine is polished, well-rounded and packed with generous fruit flavors. A baking spice aroma leads to rich berry flavors on the palate, while abundant yet soft tannins shape the velvety mouthfeel."
Saint Clair 2013 Pioneer Block 24 Arthur Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Saint Clair,White,Pioneer Block 24 Arthur,Sauvignon Blanc,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13%,$27,91,Joe Czerwinski,"With only 56 cases imported, this may be one of the hardest Saint Clair wines to find, but it offers a refreshingly austere alternative to some of the winery's other bottlings. It's only medium bodied, with delicate, leafy aromas and pristine white-grapefruit flavors. Convincingly dry and bracing on the finish, it would make a brisk counterpoint to rich fish dishes."
Ökonomierat Rebholz 2017 Kastanienbusch GG Riesling (Pfalz),Ökonomierat Rebholz,White,Kastanienbusch GG,Riesling,"Pfalz, Germany",13%,$115,95,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Hints of spring blossom, white peach and crushed earth are elegant on the nose of this dry, full-bodied Riesling. Crisp grapefruit and stone fruit flavors are crisp yet deeply penetrating, edged by racy acidity and zesty tangs of minerality. It drinks beautifully already but should intensify its mineral nuances with time."
Chalk Hill 2005 Unfined & Unfiltered Founder's Block Chardonnay (Chalk Hill),Chalk Hill,White,Unfined & Unfiltered Founder's Block,Chardonnay,"Chalk Hill, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,VivinoGary's Wine,92,,"The block is the oldest on the estate, with extremely low-yielding vines, and the wine is not produced every year. The resulting Chard is very concentrated and dense. Everything about it is big: the apricot and peach fruit, the smoky oak, the yeasty lees. Tasted in August 2007, the wine was a little disconnected, like the parts of an enormous machine that has not yet been put together. Give this ambitious young wine a year or so to come together."
Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Grand Muscadelle Tokay (Rutherglen),Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,Port/Sherry,Grand Muscadelle,"Tokay, Other White","Rutherglen, Victoria, Australia",,$140,91,Joe Czerwinski,"Dark amber in color, with some greening evident at the rim, this Tokay features aromas of scorched coffee and Guinness stout-like flavors, but is also sweet, with hints of molasses and raisins. It's a solid effort, representative of its classification."
Stringer 2018 Shokrian Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),Stringer,Red,Shokrian Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",14%,$35,93,Matt Kettmann,"Ripe and easily accessible aromas of black cherry, star anise and cardamom draw the nose into this bottling from a vineyard near Los Alamos. The big fruit flavors blow up on the palate too, with cherry, hibiscus, vanilla and oak toast, yet a firm tannic texture and plenty of acidity maintain balance."
Epiphany 2018 Hampton Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),Epiphany,Red,Hampton Vineyard,,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$39,94,Matt Kettmann,"Heady aromas of blistered blackberry, dark cocoa, cappuccino and wood spice invite the nose into this single-vineyard expression from the eastern side of the Santa Ynez Valley. Chalky tannins and firm acidity frame rounded flavors of dark fruit, white pepper and vanilla. This will be a joy to drink for years. Drink now–2033."
Cascina Chicco 1999 Bric Loira  (Barbera d'Alba),Cascina Chicco,Red,Bric Loira,Barbera,"Barbera d'Alba, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$28,89,Michael Schachner,"Piercing aromas of damp earth, cocoa and leather tell you most of what you need to know: This is the real deal. A mouth full of cherry and currant may not push finesse, but the fruit is merciless in its intensity. Juicy and full, with gas in the tank."
Verus Vineyards 2009 Furmint (Štajerska),Verus Vineyards,White,,"Furmint, Other White",,12.5%,$20,83,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While savory and smoky on the nose with subdued aromas of apple and pineapple, this dry yet fruity Furmint from Slovenia offers a host of bright tropical flavors. Full bodied with a bracingly high acidity that's a tad off-balance, it's a refreshing wine for everyday."
Santa Julia 2007 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),Santa Julia,Red,Reserva,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$12,86,Michael Schachner,"Cherry and plum-like aromas carry a dry, dusty edge and some stem, but as a whole this wine is light on its feet, easy to drink and proper. The flavors are quite red in scope, with a twinge of buttery oak adding softness. Licorice and another tick of wood take care of the finish. A fresh, forward wine for everyday use."
Rancho Sisquoc 2015 Flood Family Vineyards Syrah (Santa Barbara County),Rancho Sisquoc,Red,Flood Family Vineyards,,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",13%,$25,88,Matt Kettmann,"Bright and plump fruits of black plum and boysenberry are drizzled with tar and dusted with savory peppercorns on the nose of this bottling, which also has a gamy hint of roast lamb. The palate is a tad thin but full of flavor, with boysenberry, lavender and thyme flavors."
Spadafora 2008 Vigna Fiego Red (Donnici),Spadafora,Red,Vigna Fiego,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Donnici, Southern Italy, Italy",13%,,87,,"There's a fresh, bright quality to this blend of Magliocco, Greco Nero and Malvasia grapes. It delivers aromas of crushed white pepper, prune and exotic spice."
Nugnes 2014 Masseria Santi Apostoli Aglianico (Campania),Nugnes,Red,Masseria Santi Apostoli,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Campania, Southern Italy, Italy",12.5%,,85,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of steeped prune, resin and a whiff of cocoa lead the nose.

Dry and elegant, it is ripe, but shows the acidity from the cool 2010 vintage."
Kiona 2013 Chenin Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Kiona,White,,Chenin Blanc,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",12.8%,$15,91,Paul Gregutt,"It's listed on the back label as off dry, and in fact has 11 g/L of residual sugar, but it boasts a certain roundness and fruit persistence. Though labeled Columbia Valley, in fact it's 100% estate (Red Mountain) fruit, and old vine—30+ years—to boot. It's well-crafted, with a mix of citrus—flesh and rind—plenty of backing acidity and a thoroughly refreshing finish."
Cavalli Tenuta degli Dei 2007 Red (Toscana),Cavalli Tenuta degli Dei,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$45,93,,"From fashion designer Roberto Cavalli's wine estate (run by his son Tommaso), this elegant super Tuscan blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Alicante Bouschet opens with compelling intensity and pristine aromas of ripe blackberry, spice, leather and dark chocolate."

Maria D'Orni,Rose,Fonte Venna,"Rosato, Rosé","Terre di Chieti, Central Italy, Italy",12.5%,$14,85,Alexander Peartree,"Closed aromas of yeast, pollen and plastic eventually open up to reveal a candied watermelon tone. This is light in profile on the palate, with melon and balsamic flavors lifted by bright acidity."
Alysian 2009 Westwise Farms Clone 4 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Alysian,White,Westwise Farms Clone 4,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$40,84,,"Tastes overworked and sweetly heavy, with super-extracted pineapple jam, orange tapioca and butterscotch flavors. A heavy hand has been applied here."
Yering Station 1999 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yarra Valley),Yering Station,Red,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Yarra Valley, Victoria, Australia",13.9%,$43,90,,"Classy, sexy and certainly ageworthy. Dusty, meaty, peppery aromas lead to a palate rife with dark fruit and substantial oak. Supple in the mouth, with burly black fruit and wheat flour on the finish. Drink through 2012."
Martin & Weyrich 2006 Unwooded Chardonnay (Central Coast),Martin & Weyrich,White,Unwooded,Chardonnay,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$14,83,,"As much as I enjoy acidity in a wine, this is one of the rare ones that has too much. It's so prickly sharp, it's almost still fermenting, while the flavors are grape and apple-like. Tasted in July 2007, it may settle down eventually."
Ken Wright 2017 Hirschy Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yamhill-Carlton),Ken Wright,Red,Hirschy Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Yamhill-Carlton, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.3%,$63,92,Paul Gregutt,"There's a lot of sweet spice in the nose and in the mouth, with matching (in terms of intensity) blackberry and black cherry fruit. As with a number of the winery's 2017s, an impression of sea-salt caramel adds texture and flavor to the extended finish."
Faust 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Faust,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,VivinoWine.com,82,,"Oak completely overwhelms this wine. All you can smell and taste is char, caramel and wood spice, and the tannins, which are partly from oak barrels, are dense and hard. It's difficult even to discern any underlying fruit flavors, although if you try hard, you stumble across blackberries."
Pech Merle 2013 Ivy Rosé de Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),Pech Merle,Rose,Ivy Rosé de,,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.8%,$19,84,,"This blush was blended with 20% Zinfandel.

Wolf Blass 2001 Black Label Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),Wolf Blass,Red,Black Label,,"South Australia, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$62,88,,"This 71-29 Shriaz-Cab blend is heavy on meat and coffee aromas, and juicy blackberry and plum flavors. Vanilla and cream are the uniting factors here, making for a rich, luscious, drink now wine. Imported by Foster's Wine Estates Americas."
Domaine du Deffends 2011 Rosé d'une Nuit Rosé (Coteaux Varois),Domaine du Deffends,Rose,Rosé d'une Nuit,Rosé,"Coteaux Varois, Provence, France",13.5%,$25,90,Roger Voss,"Delicious and crisp, this has an initial taste of intense citrus and red fruit. The sensation carries through the wine, with a fruity yet taut and mineral-driven texture. There is great fruit on the finish."
Freelander 2016 District One Cabernet Sauvignon (California),Freelander,Red,District One,Cabernet Sauvignon,"California, California Other, California, US",13.5%,$13,84,Jim Gordon,Candied cherry and charred oak flavors tumble through this jazzed up medium-bodied wine along with cherry-syrup flavors and a candied impression on the finish.
Turnbull 2009 Leopoldina Cabernet Franc (Oakville),Turnbull,Red,Leopoldina,Cabernet Franc,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$60,88,,"This is dry, full bodied and pretty tannic, with a sense of elegance, plus flavors of sour cherry candy, red licorice, tobacco and sweet, smoky cedar."
Il Cocco 2007  Rosso di Montalcino,Il Cocco,Red,,"Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese","Rosso di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,,90,,"Here is a very impressive Rosso di Montalcino with thick, rich concentration and pretty aromas of black fruit, spice and cola. This is more than a “baby Brunello” as Rosso di Montalcino is sometimes called: it's a rich, steady wine that holds its own against some of the better wines of the region. The tannins are tight and firm."
Lucas & Lewellen 2018 High 9 Goodchild Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),Lucas & Lewellen,Red,High 9 Goodchild Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$35,90,Matt Kettmann,"Pomegranate and hibiscus aromas float across cinnamon stick spices on the nose of this single-vineyard, block-designated expression. The spice is powerful on the palate as well, giving a kick to the potpourri, cedar and cranberry flavors."
Kevin White 2016 Reserve Red (Yakima Valley),Kevin White,Red,Reserve,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.7%,$40,93,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is near equal parts Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre from Elephant Mountain, Boushey and Sugarloaf vineyards. The black pepper, white pepper, garrigue, blueberry, cassis, dark strawberry and smoked meat aromas show a lot of complexity. Smoked meat, orange peel, strawberry and plum flavors follow, showing mesmerizing purity and verticality. An extended finish caps it off. It's a complete knockout."
Della 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Della,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$60,87,Virginie Boone,"A heavy, full-bodied commingling of cola and dark cherry, this offers bites of minty bay leaf along the way. This accent is welcome and yet risks getting overcome by the ripeness of fruit."
Brotherhood 2010 Riesling (New York),Brotherhood,White,,Riesling,"New York, New York Other, New York, US",12%,$10,84,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Stunning aromatically, with a veil of smoke and petrol that lingers over fresh, clean Honeycrisp apple aromas. Semidry in style, with a simple, slightly sugary attack, it finishes with just a tinge of green pepper in the backdrop."
Vinos de Arganza 2013 Flavium Premium Mencía (Bierzo),Vinos de Arganza,Red,Flavium Premium,"Mencía, Spanish Red","Bierzo, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$17,84,Michael Schachner,"Currant and cherry aromas come with a volatile hint of vinegar. This is narrow on the palate, with hard-clamping tannins. Flavors of red plum, currant and tomato end raw, tart and peppery, with an herbal aftertaste."
Ventolaio 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,Ventolaio,Red,,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",15%,$60,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Underbrush, porcini mushroom, chopped mint, used leather and eucalyptus aromas lead the nose. It's robust and somewhat one-dimensional, with flavors suggesting prune, dried cherry marinated in spirits, fig and a hint of cinnamon alongside big but not very persistent tannins."
Quinta Cruz 2013 Pierce Ranch Tempranillo (San Antonio Valley),Quinta Cruz,Red,Pierce Ranch,Tempranillo,"San Antonio Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$20,89,Matt Kettmann,"Smashed Concord grapes, lavender and more purple flower aromas make for a very purple-leaning nose on this bottling from the hot stretches of southern Monterey County. The flavors are also quite violet-like, with lavender, jasmine, black plum, olallieberry, plum blossoms, and dill, altogether quite elegant with a relatively light touch."
Black Ridge 2013 San Andreas Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),Black Ridge,Red,San Andreas,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Santa Cruz Mountains, Central Coast, California, US",15.3%,$60,88,Matt Kettmann,"Violets, lilacs, black fruits and star anise make for a very showy nose on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Very floral flavors arise on the sip, where grainy tannins carry ripe black-plum-paste flavors."
Jean-Baptiste Adam 2007 Kaefferkopf Vielles Vignes Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Jean-Baptiste Adam,White,Kaefferkopf Vielles Vignes Grand Cru,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$55,85,,"Opens with a classic nose of cream, citrus and spice, giving way to cotton candy, cardamon and café latte in the mouth. The crisp, dry finish of roasted nuts is attractive but doesn't really linger."
Terredora Di Paolo 2018 Le Loggia della Serra  (Greco di Tufo),Terredora Di Paolo,White,Le Loggia della Serra,"Greco, Italian White","Greco di Tufo, Southern Italy, Italy",13%,$25,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Enticing scents of spring blossoms, citrus, white stone fruit and Mediterranean brush waft out of the glass. Structured and loaded with finesse, the vibrant, linear palate delivers Meyer lemon, white peach, Bartlett pear and tangy saline notes before a long, crisp finish. Drink through 2024."
Maddalena 2006 Merlot (Paso Robles),Maddalena,Red,,Merlot,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$15,87,,"Quite a nice Merlot, and it's even nicer when you see the everyday price. Dry and balanced, it shows rich cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors, with some bitterness that a juicy char-broiled steak will easily conquer."
Kunde 2001 Viognier (Sonoma Valley),Kunde,White,,Viognier,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$23,88,,"Scads of fruits and flowers mark this ripe, rich wine. Peaches, bananas, apricots, honeysuckle, papaya and lime flavors drink smooth and crisp, thanks to good acids. The wine is dry, clean and crisp. Lovely by itself, or with spicy, fruity-sweet foods."
Ventosa 2012 Tocai Friulano (Seneca Lake),Ventosa,White,,"Tocai Friulano, Italian White","Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York, US",11.9%,$16,83,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Tart and lean, this unusually brisk Tocai Friulano juxtapoes savory apple and citrus against a bounty of leafy green and herbal tones. It's refreshingly spry but vegetal in tone."
RiverAerie 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),RiverAerie,Red,,,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$22,84,Paul Gregutt,"Sharply defined aromas, with a little funk at the base, lead into tart red fruits and flavors of slightly bitter herbs. The fruit fades quickly, leaving tart flavors of stem and leaf in its wake."
Georges Vigouroux 2019 Gouleyant Rosé (Côtes du Lot),Georges Vigouroux,Rose,Gouleyant,Rosé,"Côtes du Lot, Southwest France, France",11.5%,$10,87,Roger Voss,"Lightly textured and with ripe berry fruits, this is a smooth wine. The acidity gives a fine touch of freshness to the wild strawberry fruits that are perfumed and refreshing. Drink now."
Domaine de Roche Noire 2018  Moulin-à-Vent,Domaine de Roche Noire,Red,,Gamay,"Moulin-à-Vent, Beaujolais, France",13.5%,$26,90,Roger Voss,"This structured wine has firm tannins as well as plenty of ripe fruits. A single-vineyard wine, it shows concentration as well as lifted acidity and generous fruits. Drink from late 2020."
Château Saint-Nabor 2012 Domaine Saint Nabor Gris de Nabor Rosé (Gard),Château Saint-Nabor,Rose,Domaine Saint Nabor Gris de Nabor,Rosé,"Gard, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",12.5%,$13,87,Lauren Buzzeo,"The bouquet of this rosé is soft and delicate, with subtle notes of strawberry hull, watermelon rind and white-plum flesh. The mouthfeel is light, but with a slight roundness to the midpalate, with a lightly bitter-lime flavor that adds zip to the finish."
V. Sattui 2017 Merlot (Napa Valley),V. Sattui,Red,,Merlot,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.8%,$39,88,Virginie Boone,"This includes 9% Malbec and smaller amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, the whole aged 14 months in French oak. A thickness of tannin and oak dominate within a context of rich chocolate mocha and raspberry jam."
Lightpost 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Lightpost,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$30,91,Matt Kettmann,"Focused aromas of blackberry wrapped in cedar and dusted with milk chocolate show on the nose of this bottling. There's a hit of mint on the sip, alongside blackberry cream and vanilla, with sandy tannins holding the fruit together."
Venge 2011 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Venge,Red,Family Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",14.9%,$145,93,Virginie Boone,"Aged more than two years in air-dried French oak, this is classic Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon, velvety and plush. It boasts juicy blackberry and black cherry fruit aromas and flavors, with weighty oak and a mix of coconut flake and chocolate that linger on the finish."
Château la Gaffelière 2008 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),Château la Gaffelière,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,92,Roger Voss,"91-93 Barrel sample. This has super-ripe fruit, but it has been controlled by a dense series of tannin layers. The acidity is in the same sweet character, giving a wine that is both fruity and serious."
Tinhof 2017 Gloriette Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),Tinhof,Red,Gloriette,"Blaufränkisch, Other Red","Burgenland, Austria",13.5%,$80,96,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The nose is rather shy but gives the slightest, most subtle whiff of camphor. For now the palate shows off its very fine-boned, graceful and soaring structure of filigree tannins as well as its pervasive and bright freshness. But the lovely cherry fruit at the heart of this elegant yet powerful wine still needs to unfold, just like all the surrounding aromatics that have something floral, fresh and beautifully lifted. A picture of finesse and elegance. Drink 2025–2045."
Clos Pegase 2012 Mitsuko's Vineyard Merlot (Carneros),Clos Pegase,Red,Mitsuko's Vineyard,Merlot,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.9%,DrizlyVivino,87,Virginie Boone,"Softly layered in crisp red fruit, from currant to strawberry, this is a medium-bodied wine with a medium finish, seasoned in compelling jolts of cinnamon spice. From the relatively cool climes of its appellation, it's juicy without ever becoming overwhelming in tannin."
Coppo 2016 Pomorosso  (Nizza),Coppo,Red,Pomorosso,Barbera,"Nizza, Piedmont, Italy",15.5%,$75,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Mature black-skinned fruit, leather, blue flower and exotic spice mingle with balsamic notes on this brawny red. The jammy palate shows baked plum, ripe blackberry, tobacco and oak-driven spice set against enveloping tannins and the warmth of alcohol."
Pepperwood Grove 2002 Viognier (California),Pepperwood Grove,White,,Viognier,"California, California Other, California, US",,$9,84,,"A fruity, easy sipper with lots of peach, pear, apricot and citrus fruit flavors that drink crisp and clean. It's fairly dry, with a ripe, honeyed taste that brings all that fruit together on the finish."
Yamhill Valley 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (McMinnville),Yamhill Valley,Red,Estate,Pinot Noir,"McMinnville, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.9%,$22,83,Paul Gregutt,"Volatile and showing some scents of glue, this hides its cherry fruit. It's drinkable, but for those with a high sensitivity to volatility it may be problematic."
Warrabilla 2000 Petite Sirah (Rutherglen),Warrabilla,Red,,Petite Sirah,"Rutherglen, Victoria, Australia",13.2%,$27,88,Joe Czerwinski,"This big and broodingly dark wine is packed with grapey fruit and vanilla. The tannins on the finish are dusty but ripe and should preserve the wine for up to 10 years in the cellar. Still, why not drink it now with barbecue and savor the youthfully lusty fruit? —J.C."
La Montagne 2013 Huber Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),La Montagne,White,Huber Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.6%,$42,91,Matt Kettmann,"It conveys Asian influences, with lemongrass leading the nose alongside chalkiness, lemon curd and soft peach. Those elements power the palate too, with lemongrass, Thai basil and coconut milk framed by yellow grapefruit acidity and Chinese spice. Serve with pho."
Benovia 2008 Cohn Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),Benovia,Red,Cohn Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$62,91,,"Here's a Pinot to enjoy now with steak, or try a Julia Child-inspired coq au vin. It's big and sturdy and ripe, with cherry, currant, licorice and beef teriyaki flavors that finish in a swirl of spices. The tannins are substantial. Give it a few hours of decanting."
Astrale e Terra 2004 Estate Syrah (Atlas Peak),Astrale e Terra,Red,Estate,,"Atlas Peak, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$28,88,,"At the age of five-plus, this is still a pretty aggressive wine in tannins, with a sandpapery astringency through the finish. But it's also incredibly fruity, offering a blast of superripe blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate and pepper. Seems best now and for a couple years."
Penfolds 2009 St. Henri Shiraz (South Australia),Penfolds,Red,St. Henri,,"South Australia, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$99,93,Joe Czerwinski,"Because St. Henri is aged exclusively in large, mostly neutral oak vessels, it often requires more time to come around than Shiraz aged in barrel. The 2009 is tight and reticent on the nose, while showing hints of boysenberry, black olive and roasted meat on the palate. Full bodied, rich and firm in structure, with a long, amply textured finish, it needs a few years in the cellar, and should last at least through 2030."
Renteria 2013 Chardonnay (Los Carneros),Renteria,White,,Chardonnay,"Los Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$40,90,Virginie Boone,"This is a beautifully floral, high in acidity white made in small quantities that offers classically lean layers of wet stone and lemon. With a low imprint of oak, it remains structured on the palate and entirely pleasing from start to finish, its honeysuckle aromas singularly inviting."
Bedell 1998 Cupola Red (North Fork of Long Island),Bedell,Red,Cupola,"Red Blends, Red Blends","North Fork of Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",,$30,87,Joe Czerwinski,"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Cabernet Franc, with 5% each Malbec and Petit Verdot is very primary, showing lots of bright cherry fruit and a judicious dose of vanilla oak. A juicy, fun wine that would make for good drinking this summer and on into fall. Bottled 9/00, release date undetermined."
Solar de la Vega 2006 Verdejo (Rueda),Solar de la Vega,White,,"Verdejo, Spanish White","Rueda, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$8,86,Michael Schachner,A better effort than in previous years. This vintage has a tangy personality and no tricks up its sleeve. The pineapple and citrus flavors are solid and the finish holds onto the Verdejo's citrusy profile. Steady and clean all the way through.
Domaines Ott 1998 Les Domaniers de Calignade Red (Côtes de Provence),Domaines Ott,Rose,Les Domaniers de Calignade,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Côtes de Provence, Provence, France",12.5%,$11,84,Michael Schachner,"The pleasant salmon color should persuade you to crack it open. Light orange and peach aromas lead to the same flavors and a touch of cantaloupe. It's a totally competent rosé, what you might drink in the summer in France. But even if you're stuck in Paris, Texas, it's a decent quaffer made from Grenache, Syrah and Cinsault."
Las Valles 2012 Viura-Chardonnay (Cariñena),Las Valles,White,,"Viura-Chardonnay, White Blend","Cariñena, Northern Spain, Spain",12%,$9,81,Michael Schachner,"Chemical notes sit atop aromas of peach pit and green banana. This is narrow in the mouth, with mealy melon and tropical fruit flavors. A peachy finish lacks finesse and more."
Poggio Antico 2009  Rosso di Montalcino,Poggio Antico,Red,,"Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese","Rosso di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,VivinoGary's Wine,86,,"There's a youthful, brambly character to this Rosso that appears as dried sage, rosemary, forest berry and wild mushroom. The wine is bright, fresh and streamlined."
Septima 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Septima,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$12,87,Michael Schachner,"Concentrated, dark and clean for a basic 2008 Cabernet, with full but generic berry aromas and a pinch of rubber. The body is good and so is the structure, and overall the wine's roasted berry flavors blend well with sweet vanilla and caramel. Very good for value-priced Argentine CS."
Dampierre NV Cuvée des Ambassadeurs Brut Rosé  (Champagne),Dampierre,Sparkling,Cuvée des Ambassadeurs Brut Rosé,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12.5%,,91,Roger Voss,"This is a full in the mouth, forward and fruity rosé, that is all fresh acidity and lively, crisp flavors. It has a light, zesty texture and the merest hint of toastiness. Drink now or give it a year's bottle aging."
Armanino Family Cellars 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Armanino Family Cellars,Red,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.8%,$95,89,,"Marked by acidity, strong tannins and powerful fruit, this Cabernet is a three-way playoff. The fruit is the obvious early victor, flashy in plums, blackberries, cassis and cedar. But the astringency makes it difficult to enjoy now. Cellar for six years, and see what happens."
Billsboro 2012 Sawmill Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes),Billsboro,White,Sawmill Creek Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12%,$18,85,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"There's a tinge of herbaceous green stem amidst fresh apple and lemon aromas on this Sauvignon Blanc blended with 10% Albariño. Marked with nervous lime acidity, it's lean on the palate with a hint of lime-skin bitterness on the finish."
Szigeti NV Rosé Brut Grand Cru Red (Österreichischer Sekt),Szigeti,Sparkling,Rosé Brut Grand Cru,,"Österreichischer Sekt, Austria",13%,,85,Roger Voss,"A soft, creamy rosé sparkler, made by the traditional method, giving a light mousse, with suggestions of strawberries and a gentle, lightly acid aftertaste."
Big Basin 2014 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),Big Basin,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",13%,$36,90,Matt Kettmann,"This appellation blend of Bradley Brown's Pinot projects aims at a low-alcohol, greener style, thanks to 85% whole-cluster inclusion, with green peppercorns, Kalamata olives, tomato leaf and even jalapeño on the nose. Those qualities make the palate incredibly interesting though very light and what many consumers may find underripe, with touches of strawberry fruit, dried dill, graphite and eucalyptus."
Rex Hill 2015 Jacob-Hart Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Rex Hill,Red,Jacob-Hart Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.7%,$65,94,Paul Gregutt,"Not quite as ripe as the 2014 but just as delicious, this biodynamically-farmed estate wine is Rex Hill's top reserve. Its old vine complexity shows in its substantial, full-bodied berry, plum and cherry flavors, a beet root note running down the center. At this time, the barrel aging flavors are a bit hidden, but experience suggests it will continue to improve over the next decade or longer."
Veuve du Vernay NV Brut - Blanc de Blancs  (France),Veuve du Vernay,Sparkling,Brut - Blanc de Blancs,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","France, France Other, France",11%,$10,84,Paul Gregutt,"Extremely light and yeasty, there are subtle whiffs of baked apple and sweet cracker in the nose, but no real weight in the mouth. Neutral green-apple fruit and a pleasantly beery finish, with just a hint of bitterness."
Beaulieu Vineyard 1997 Coastal Sauvignon Blanc (California),Beaulieu Vineyard,White,Coastal,Sauvignon Blanc,"California, California Other, California, US",13.4%,DrizlyVivino,83,,"Born to be mild. Grapefruit, herbs and toast on the nose. Soft flavors, not overly oaked; but only very subtle citrus fruit on the palate. Decent mouthfeel, with some body. The oak comes on a bit much for the light fruit on the finish."
Ladera 2003 Lone Canyon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Ladera,Red,Lone Canyon Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.6%,$65,84,,"Ripe and tasty, with cassis, cherries and sweet new oak flavors. But it has a sweaty, funky smell, and is excessively soft, making the wine melted and flat."
Flaunt 2019 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Flaunt,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14%,$40,90,Virginie Boone,"Fresh and carbonic in lively red fruit and a tang of citrus, this coastal wine is funky and earthy. Thick tannins support a core of forest floor, clove and black tea."
Mark Ryan 2008 Water Witch Red (Red Mountain),Mark Ryan,Red,Water Witch,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.8%,$45,94,Paul Gregutt,"Great structure supports a massive, Cabernet-dominated wine, predictably loaded with ripe, chewy tannins. The flavors spread out thickly over deep and brambly black cherry fruit, layering in highlights of smoke and toffee."
Syan 2005 Tradition Red (Pyrenees),Syan,Red,Tradition,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Pyrenees, Victoria, Australia",14.8%,$25,88,Joe Czerwinski,"This easy-to-drink, medium-bodied red blends 31% Merlot, 28% Shiraz, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Cabernet Franc, then adds lashings of toasty, vanilla-scented oak. The result is a supple wine redolent of plums, vanilla and baking spices that finishes soft and creamy-smooth. Ready to drink now."
Madrigal 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley),Madrigal,Red,,Merlot,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$26,87,,"A deliciously soft, easy-drinking Merlot for enjoying tonight with a nice steak or burger. It's basically dry, but ultrarich and sweet in raspberry, cherry, cocoa and baking spice flavors."
Alamos 2000 Malbec (Mendoza),Alamos,Red,,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$13,83,Michael Schachner,"Wood-driven spicy aromas dominate the bouquet, which offers too little fruit and only a hint of clove. Raspberry and red cherry flavors come before a dry, simple woody finish. Given the light, lean body weight of this wine, the oak comes on a bit strong and drying."
Vasco Urbano 2015 The Sheriff G-S-M (Livermore Valley),Vasco Urbano,Red,The Sheriff,"G-S-M, Rhône-style Red Blend","Livermore Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.8%,$42,89,Jim Gordon,"This full-bodied wine is seriously oaky and tannic, filling the aroma with smoke, cedar and pepper and the flavor with roasted, meaty and darkly fruity flavors like macerated blackberries. The texture is heavily tannic and somewhat drying but the rich fruit notes come back on the finish for relief."
Domaine Laporte 2020 Les Grandmontains Rosé (Sancerre),Domaine Laporte,Rose,Les Grandmontains,Rosé,"Sancerre, Loire Valley, France",13%,$32,88,Roger Voss,"Softly textured with red fruits, this is a ripe wine. Freshness comes with the crushed-strawberry flavors and touch of lemon at the end. Drink now. Organic."
V. Sattui 2009 Henry Ranch Merlot (Los Carneros),V. Sattui,Red,Henry Ranch,Merlot,"Los Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$29,86,,"This is a little too heavy and full bodied, but it's bone dry and rich in blackberry and currant flavors, with an earthiness that suggests mushrooms. Drink over the next year or two."
Kramer 2013 Celebrate Pinot Gris (Yamhill-Carlton),Kramer,Sparkling,Celebrate,,"Yamhill-Carlton, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",12.5%,$22,85,Paul Gregutt,"This young sparkler is bracingly tart, and seems to have zero dosage. Flavors are simple, fruity and fresh, and the wine works well as a base for cocktails."
Wineglass Cellars 1999 Merlot (Yakima Valley),Wineglass Cellars,Red,,Merlot,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$22,90,Paul Gregutt,"The lush, satiny nose mixes ripe fruit and pleasing herbal, dusty scents. There's even a little bit of jalapeño (from young tannins) in the finish, along with some red licorice. On balance, a distinctive style, with all kinds of interesting, subtle notes, yet still classic, varietal Washington-style Merlot."
Mas Igneus 1999 FA 104 Blanco White (Priorat),Mas Igneus,White,FA 104 Blanco,White Blend,"Priorat, Catalonia, Spain",,$19,88,,"A lovely and unusual Bergamot-like citrus-blossom note runs through this attractive wine. The full nose displays hay and creamy nougat, and the mouth is a melange of orange, almond and herb flavors. This solid white has unique character and closes long, with citrus and nut flavors and a fine spicy back-bouquet. Worth seeking out, this is reminiscent of some Rhône whites. —M.M."
Buena Vista 2016 Chateau Buena Vista Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Buena Vista,Red,Chateau Buena Vista,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15%,$50,88,Virginie Boone,"Soft and approachable in richness and ripeness, this big bold wine is full of blueberry-jam and chocolate-mocha flavors, with a moderate structure that keeps it round in the glass. Cedar, dust and oak accent the lushness."
Bailly-Lapierre NV Rosé Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),Bailly-Lapierre,Sparkling,Rosé Brut,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Crémant de Bourgogne, Burgundy, France",12%,$25,88,Roger Voss,"Mainly Pinot Noir with a touch of Gamay, this fruity wine is bright with acidity and crisp red-currant flavors. Its acidity and zesty character are enhanced by the lively mousse. Drink now."
Jean-Marc Bernhard 2016 Cuvée Particulière Pinot Gris (Alsace),Jean-Marc Bernhard,White,Cuvée Particulière,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",14%,$17,88,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A touch of yeasty funk still clings to the pear-fruit nose. The palate brims with ripe juicy pear, helped along by some residual sweetness, and is contained by a pleasantly bitter zestiness. The body is slender but rounded and pervasive. A lively freshness lets it finish dry."
Domaine Daniel Dampt & Fils 2019 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis),Domaine Daniel Dampt & Fils,White,Fourchaume Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Chablis, Burgundy, France",13%,,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"An edge of warmth and seeming sunshine joins the fresh lemony nose of this wine. The palate comes in with roundness and texture, suggesting mellow apple flesh that is toned with lemon brightness and has gorgeous depth. Profundity is set off by spiky lemon freshness for enlivening contrast."
Fetzer 2000 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),Fetzer,Red,Bien Nacido Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$40,88,,"Plump, almost slick, this Pinot offers plenty of satisfaction in its dark berry, tar, nut and toasted oak flavors. The palate's black plum, caramel, spice and cedar have great appeal, as do the pepper and spice on the long finish."
Otazu 2006 Altar Red (Navarra),Otazu,Red,Altar,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Navarra, Northern Spain, Spain",14.5%,$45,90,Michael Schachner,"Cool rooty aromas of cola and tree bark grace the nose on this ripe but still not fully mature Cabernet Sauvignon (with 5% Merlot). In the mouth, this is choppy due to sandpaper tannins. Flavors of sarsaparilla, pepper, and blackberry are dense and chewy, while the finish is bumpy and scraping due to aforementioned hard tannins. Drink or hold through 2022."
Le Bocce 1997 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Le Bocce,Red,Riserva,Sangiovese,"Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",13%,$24,89,,"Good balance and a sense of proportion characterize this handsome, classically styled Chianti. Displays aromas of cherry, leather and spice and dark-cherry flavors, cocoa accents and nice acidity on the palate. The long and flavorful finish makes it very appealing for current consumption, and it should improve further over the next year or two."
Kohl 2015 Classic Zweigelt (Niederösterreich),Kohl,Red,Classic,"Zweigelt, Other Red","Niederösterreich, Austria",13.5%,$19,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Abundant cherry notes show on the nose and palate of this wine—red, black and very ripe. It's juicy, fresh and straight-forward, with lovely, peppery spice. A picnic wine par excellence."
Michel Vattan 2017 Cuvée Calcaire  (Sancerre),Michel Vattan,White,Cuvée Calcaire,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sancerre, Loire Valley, France",12.5%,$25,91,Roger Voss,"As its name indicates, this wine comes from chalk soil. Crisp minerality is the order of the day, with intense acidity, layers of citrus and a zesty, bright texture. There is a herbal element that will soften. Drink from 2019."
Southard 2011 Lawrence Vineyard Le Paon Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),Southard,Rose,Lawrence Vineyard Le Paon,Rosé,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.5%,$20,92,Paul Gregutt,"Put this into a blind flight of French rosé, and it will seem like one of the crowd. Crafted from 65% Grenache, 29% Syrah and 6% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is bone dry, dusty and detailed, showing a gorgeous onion-skin hue. The elegance and length are exceptional."
Alpamanta 2014 Natal Malbec (Mendoza),Alpamanta,Red,Natal,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.5%,$13,85,Michael Schachner,"Brambly berry and leather aromas are rustic. This Malbec is hard and acidic. Short, generic plum and berry flavors don't expand or improve on the finish."
H. Blin NV Brut Tradition  (Champagne),H. Blin,Sparkling,Brut Tradition,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12.5%,$50,88,Roger Voss,"A blend of Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay, this is crisp while also rounded. Fresh, tight acidity under a creamy texture brings out the sliced apple and Rocha pear flavors. There's no need to age this bottling; it's ready to drink."
Luzy-Macarez 2017 Rive Dorée  (Viré-Clessé),Luzy-Macarez,White,Rive Dorée,Chardonnay,"Viré-Clessé, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$45,91,Roger Voss,"From a project by Richard Luzy and François Macarez, this wine is full bodied while preserving a tense texture. The acidity and intense, juicy white-fruit flavors are just melded together, with the promise of further aging. Drink this wine from late 2020."
Bründlmayer 2014 Steinmassel Riesling (Kamptal),Bründlmayer,White,Steinmassel,Riesling,"Kamptal, Austria",12.5%,$35,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,"There is something eternally invigorating in this citrus-pure Riesling that smacks of grapefruit and lemon zest. There is a softer apple aspect too, uniting all in a fresh, pure fruitiness. There is something simply authentic at its very heart that keeps you sipping. And with such a light-bodied wine, you can (almost) do so with impunity."
Gustafson Family 2009 Watchtower Vineyard Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),Gustafson Family,Red,Watchtower Vineyard Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$38,91,,"A very fine Cabernet, showing the soft tannins and herbaceousness of many Sonoma County Cabs. At the same time, there's a sweet streak of blackberry jam and mocha. Feels fine and and balanced in the mouth, with brisk tannins and a long, complex finish. One of the better Dry Creek Cabs out there, it will provide good drinking over the next 5–6 years."
Luis Cañas 2004 Hiru 3 Racimos  (Rioja),Luis Cañas,Red,Hiru 3 Racimos,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",14.5%,$118,91,Michael Schachner,"Lively and intense, with a true old-vines, limited-production character. The color, nose and palate are all potent and masculine. There's a ton of new oak on the nose, but it's textbook modern-style Rioja. Cassis, blackberry and various woody adornments make it work, and the finish is black as coal. Drink from late 2009 and on."
Jekel 2000 Winemaker's Collection Riesling (Monterey),Jekel,White,Winemaker's Collection,Riesling,"Monterey, Central Coast, California, US",12%,$10,85,,"The prettiest aromas are here, all peaches and wildflowers, honey and oriental spices, and a buttery, smoky note. The flavors are nice, too, suggesting apples and peaches. It's off-dry, and kind of simple, lacking the acids needed to make it shine."
Domaine des Trois Tilleuls 2018 Solutré  (Pouilly-Fuissé),Domaine des Trois Tilleuls,White,Solutré,Chardonnay,"Pouilly-Fuissé, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$65,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Gentle, hazelnutty smoke mixes with subtle creaminess on the nose of this wine. These notions get more intense on the smooth and harmonious palate. The wine has gentleness, concentration, poise and power, but all is quietly understated, leading to a long, smoky, sonorous and dry finish."
Chime 2012 Pinot Noir (Carneros),Chime,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.7%,$20,83,,"This simple Pinot has decent cranberry, cola and sour cherry flavors, but the texture feels raw and harsh, partly due to acidity and green tannins."
Cuatro Rayas 2017 Cuarenta Vendimias Sauvignon Blanc (Rueda),Cuatro Rayas,White,Cuarenta Vendimias,Sauvignon Blanc,"Rueda, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$14,88,Michael Schachner,"A lightly vegetal nose with fruitier bolts of mango and melon leads to a juicy palate with bright, banging acidity. This outdoes many Rueda Sauvignon Blancs via spicy green fruit and melon flavors and clean and proper balance. Drink now."
V. Sattui 2017 Carsi Vineyard Semillon (Napa Valley),V. Sattui,White,Carsi Vineyard,"Sémillon, Sémillon","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.6%,$28,91,Virginie Boone,"With a copper tinge of color, this is both buttery and lush with a backbone of acid that keeps it fresh and midweight in the glass. Peach, pear and anise characterize the flavor profile, finishing with a creamy texture."
Brewer-Clifton 2019 Machado Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),Brewer-Clifton,White,Machado,Chardonnay,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,VivinoGary's Wine,93,Matt Kettmann,"Delicate aromas of Meyer lemon peel, squeezed lime and orange flesh are evident on the nose of this bottling, for which only three barrels were made. A puckering acidity launches the sip, where pleasantly tart lemon and lime flavors lead into riper melon by the midpalate."
Lion Ranch 2016 Viognier (Santa Clara Valley),Lion Ranch,White,,Viognier,"Santa Clara Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.8%,$25,90,Matt Kettmann,"Tightly wound aromas of crisp Asian pear, pomelo pith and talcum show on the refreshing nose of this bottling. The palate is extremely grippy, fresh and texturally compelling, with racy flavors of grapefruit pith, Key lime rind and a hint of melon."
WillaKenzie Estate 2017 Chardonnay (Yamhill-Carlton),WillaKenzie Estate,White,,Chardonnay,"Yamhill-Carlton, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.8%,$65,89,Paul Gregutt,"This is a fairly light wine, with crisp apple, a hint of white peach and a lightly buttery finish. The aging for 18 months in 38% new French oak is still integrating, so another year or two of bottle age is recommended."
Wirra Wirra 2014 The Absconder Grenache (McLaren Vale),Wirra Wirra,Red,The Absconder,Grenache,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",14%,$65,87,Joe Czerwinski,"Crisp and edgy, featuring tart cherry fruit and hints of green peppercorn. It's fairly big in the mouth, but lacks a bit of generosity."
Gosset 2008 Celebris Rosé Brut  (Champagne),Gosset,Sparkling,Celebris Rosé Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$250,94,Roger Voss,"This rich Champagne is full of ripe red fruits balanced by red currants, green apples and a shot of citrus. The full texture only just shows maturity, but also is elegant. It is now ready to drink."
Santa Isle 2012 Grand Reserve Selected Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),Santa Isle,Red,Grand Reserve Selected Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Maule Valley, Chile",14%,$20,87,Michael Schachner,"Despite this having a distinctly green nose, there's enough cherry and currant character along with overall brightness to make this an enjoyable Cab. Oaky flavors of vanilla and cream accent cherry and red plum. The finish is oaky yet bolstered by firm acids."
2Hawk 2016 Darow Series Viognier (Rogue Valley),2Hawk,White,Darow Series,Viognier,"Rogue Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",14.5%,$39,92,Paul Gregutt,"Part of the winery's reserve tier, this was barrel-fermented, offering a totally different set of flavors from the stainless steel-fermented Viognier. It is lush on the palate, with concentrated apple, grapefruit and papaya flavors and a buttery, toasty finish."
Rivino 2013 Estate Sangiovese (Mendocino),Rivino,Red,Estate,Sangiovese,"Mendocino, Mendocino County, California, US",13.8%,$29,88,Jim Gordon,"The color of this medium-bodied wine is quite light, which is natural for some Sangioveses. Aromas recall mellow spices and light fruits, while the flavors are moderate and the texture smooth, almost light."
Michel Torino 2009 Don David Reserve Chardonnay (Cafayate),Michel Torino,White,Don David Reserve,Chardonnay,"Cafayate, Other, Argentina",13.9%,$16,86,Michael Schachner,"Tropical and zesty on the nose, with a big shot of lemon blossom and a secondary note of melon. The palate is juicy, fresh and sort of lean, with lemon, pineapple and green apple flavors. Arguably tart and angular, but at least it's clean and crisp."
Volpaia 2016 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Volpaia,Red,Riserva,Sangiovese,"Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$35,95,Kerin O’Keefe,"Varietal aromas of violet, plum and black-skinned berry shape the nose on this fragrant, polished red. On the fresh, delicious palate, velvety tannins accompany juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry and baking spice. It's nicely balanced, with bright acidity."
Unti 2007 Grenache (Dry Creek Valley),Unti,Red,,Grenache,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.9%,$30,85,,"Grenache is a terribly hard variety to make on its own. It's better used as a blender, which this wine proves. It's dry and silky, with one-dimensional cherry, blueberry and oak flavors. Drink now."
Barton & Guestier 2007  Margaux,Barton & Guestier,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",12.5%,,84,Roger Voss,"Margaux was one of the least successful of the great communes in 2007, and this wine reflects the austere character. It is relatively lightweight, with a dry core of tannins and lean red berry fruits."
Casca Wines 2016 Bote Sailing Boat Touriga Nacional-Touriga Franca Reserva Red (Douro),Casca Wines,Red,Bote Sailing Boat Touriga Nacional-Touriga Franca Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",14%,$20,89,Roger Voss,"This full-bodied, robust wine is rich in tannins and fruit. Bold berry flavors are cut with acidity layered over a dry core. Although the wine is ready to drink, it will be better from 2019."
Luis Pato 2012 Natural Baga (Beira Atlantico),Luis Pato,Red,Natural,"Baga, Portuguese Red","Beira Atlantico, Portugal",12%,$12,85,Roger Voss,"From winemaker, Luis Pato comes an easy-drinking, natural wine made without the use of sulfer. It is juicy and fruity showing red fruit tones and tangy acidity, tamed by ripe tannins. Drink now."
Miner 2016 Viognier (California),Miner,White,,Viognier,"California, California Other, California, US",13.9%,$22,88,Virginie Boone,"Stainless-steel fermented, this wine is made from grapes grown in Paso Robles and Lodi and is intensely concentrated. Pretty aromatics of honeysuckle open up before thick rich layers of lushly ripe peach flavor ride in."
Moss Wood 2015 Wilyabrup Ribbon Vale Vineyard Merlot (Margaret River),Moss Wood,Red,Wilyabrup Ribbon Vale Vineyard,Merlot,"Margaret River, Western Australia, Australia",13.5%,$57,91,Christina Pickard,"Another of Margaret River's founding wineries, Moss Wood purchased 43-year-old Ribbon Vale Vineyard in 2000. At five years old, there's some bottle age to this wine but still plenty of energy left in the battery. The nose opens with a distinctive cherry and bar soap note, backed by licorice, cigar box and dried herbs. The tannins are powerful, raspy and a touch astringent on the palate, but they nicely juxtapose the juicy, fresh fruit. Drink now–2035."
Hanna 2001 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),Hanna,Red,Estate Grown,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$27,88,,"A bit soft and herbal, with hints of tobacco, dried herbs, cherries and leather, and dry, easy tannins. That makes it sound like a classic Cab from this Sonoma County appellation. It's easy to drink, but that doesn't mean it doesn't possess some interesting complexities."
Errazuriz 2002 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Aconcagua Valley),Errazuriz,Red,Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Aconcagua Valley, Chile",13.5%,$10,88,Michael Schachner,"Broad and deep, with some rich, ripe aromatics some might called stewy. But the wine itself is balanced and healthy, with cassis, cherry and tobacco flavors. The finish sports a liqueur-like sweetness, and the tannins are just right."
Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2014 Pinot Nero (Pomino),Marchesi de' Frescobaldi,Red,,"Pinot Nero, Pinot Noir","Pomino, Tuscany, Italy",12.5%,$35,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Elegant and spicy, this ultrarefined—almost ethereal—Pinot Nero boasts aromas of wild red berry, graphite Mediterranean herb and a whiff of rhubarb. The smooth bright palate delivers strawberry, red cherry, white pepper and star anise alongside fresh acidity."
Giacosa Fratelli 2014 Bussia  (Barolo),Giacosa Fratelli,Red,Bussia,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$69,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Dark berry, baking spice and sage aromas come to the forefront. It's rather straightforward, with dried black cherry, clove and nutmeg flavors offset by assertive tannins. Drink after 2022."
Michael Pozzan 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),Michael Pozzan,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Lake County, Lake County, California, US",13%,$13,90,Jim Gordon,"This lean and refreshing wine smells minerally and tastes bright and citrusy, backed by crisp acidity and a light body. Lemon and lime merge with light herb and mineral flavors that stay lively with each sip."
Alara 2018 Mission Ranch Vineyard Albariño (Arroyo Seco),Alara,White,Mission Ranch Vineyard,Albariño,"Arroyo Seco, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$31,88,Matt Kettmann,"Exotic white- and green-fruit aromas of citrus, lychee and even Rainier cherry show on the inviting nose of this bottling. There is a compelling tightness to the palate, where a sandy grip carries flavors of light pear and broader white fruits."
Bizarra Extravaganza 2019 Vino Natural Naranja Bizarra White (Uruguay),Bizarra Extravaganza,White,Vino Natural Naranja Bizarra,White Blend,,13%,$15,88,Michael Schachner,"A burnished gold color and lightly oxidized aromas of spiced pumpkin and dried apricots lead to a round and pulpy palate with modest acidity. This orange wine made from Petit and Gros Manseng grapes tastes of spiced squash and bitter skins, while a chai flavor controls the finish."
Stemmari 2017 Estate Grown Sustainably Farmed Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),Stemmari,Red,Estate Grown Sustainably Farmed,"Nero d'Avola, Italian Red","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13%,$11,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this has aromas of black-skinned berry, Mediterranean herb and carob. The straightforward, juicy palate offers black cherry, raspberry jam and white pepper alongside polished tannins. Enjoy soon."
Krupp Brothers 2009 Veraison Red (Napa Valley),Krupp Brothers,Red,Veraison,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15.03%,$55,87,Virginie Boone,"A blend of almost equal parts Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, supported by smaller percentages of Merlot, Malbec, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, this is a sizable wine. A tight fist of dry wood tannins and tobacco carries a gamy, leathery touch to the finish."
Marrenon 2018 Grand Marrenon White (Luberon),Marrenon,White,Grand Marrenon,Rhône-style White Blend,"Luberon, Rhône Valley, France",13%,$20,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whiffs of sweet spice and sandalwood accent juicy white grapefruit, pear and pineapple in this full-bodied, fruity blend of Grenache Blanc, Vermentino and Roussanne. Aged partially in new French barrels, it's prominently oaky but balanced by crisp, citrusy acidity and a pert mineral finish. Best now–2024."
Tommasi 2016  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Tommasi,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Amarone della Valpolicella Classico, Veneto, Italy",15%,$65,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"This has a shy nose that eventually reveals whiffs of stewed prune, leather and tilled earth. The solid palate offers baked plum, candied raisin and a dollop of vanilla alongside polished, rather relaxed tannins before a bitter almond finish. Drink through 2026."
Edward Sellers 2008 Viognier (Paso Robles),Edward Sellers,White,,Viognier,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$29,84,,"Almost a dessert wine, it's so rich in sugary flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and vanillas. Crisp acidity fortunately provides clean balance, but it's not really a dry table wine."
Teruzzi & Puthod 2009 Rondolino  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),Teruzzi & Puthod,White,Rondolino,"Vernaccia, Italian White","Vernaccia di San Gimignano, Tuscany, Italy",12.5%,$12,85,,"Vernaccia Rondolino opens with fragrant aromas of citrus, green apple and passion fruit. The mouthfeel is lean and compact, but there's a nice touch of zesty freshness on the close."
Château Rauzan-Ségla 2012  Margaux,Château Rauzan-Ségla,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",,,94,Roger Voss,"This firmly structured, beautifully crafted wine has a solid backdrop of tannins and plenty of concentration. Beyond that, it is already well balanced, bringing together its dark texture and blackberry fruit flavors with generous acidity. It needs to age, drink from 2020."
Torii Mor 2005 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Torii Mor,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$29,89,Paul Gregutt,"The black label Torii Mor Pinot is often as good, if not better, than the single-vineyard bottlings. Although the price keeps creeping higher, it's fair and this 2005 is an excellent rendition. It offers fruit flavors that are ripe but not sweet or jammy, nice details of herb and root, and suggestions of moist earth and black tea. If you believe in modest (13.5% here) levels of alcohol in your Pinots, this one should ring your bell."
Montespina 2011 Verdejo (Rueda),Montespina,White,,"Verdejo, Spanish White","Rueda, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,,88,Michael Schachner,"Peach, melon and natural vanilla aromas are an open invitation to this fresh Spanish white. Feels jumpy and lively like it should, with green fruit, citrus, apple and melon flavors. Spunky on the finish, this is textbook Verdejo."
Georges Duboeuf 2016 Domaine du Riaz  (Côte de Brouilly),Georges Duboeuf,Red,Domaine du Riaz,Gamay,"Côte de Brouilly, Beaujolais, France",13%,$20,88,Roger Voss,"This wine is smooth, juicy and ripe. With broad red fruits and acidity, it has a light touch of tannins that keeps the wine's shape and texture. The wine is fruity, rich and ready to drink now."
Domaine Weinbach 2014 Cuvée Théo Gewurztraminer (Alsace),Domaine Weinbach,White,Cuvée Théo,"Gewürztraminer, Gewürztraminer","Alsace, Alsace, France",13.5%,$37,91,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Earth and stone hit long before the sultry rosewater richness. They also pervade the palate of this midweight Gewurztraminer, edged with candied lime peel. The palate is soft but shows verve. This is one to linger over."
Samuel Tinon 2007 Dry Tokaji Szamorodni Furmint (Tokaj),Samuel Tinon,Dessert,Dry Tokaji Szamorodni,"Furmint, Other White","Tokaj, Hungary",12.8%,$46,92,Jeff Jenssen,"This Szamorodni, or late-harvest wine, is amber in color with aromas of caramel and dried raisins. In the mouth, there are rich flavors of dried fruits, stewed plums and wine-soaked raisins that combine on your tongue before a juicy yet persistent finish."
Jada Vineyard & Winery 2005 Jersey Girl Syrah (Paso Robles),Jada Vineyard & Winery,Red,Jersey Girl,,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",16%,$36,87,,"Delicious, if a little superripe, with chocolate and raisin-infused blackberry and cherry flavors. Feels soft and melted in the mouth, but dry, and the tannic structure is rewardingly plush."
Villa Maria 2016 Single Vineyard Taylors Pass Pinot Noir (Marlborough),Villa Maria,Red,Single Vineyard Taylors Pass,Pinot Noir,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13%,$42,88,Christina Pickard,"From the cool, seaside Awatere Valley subregion, this sturdy Pinot starts off a little on the funky, barnyard-y side. It opens somewhat with time in the glass, revealing cherry, plum, mushroom and hoisin sauce aromas. It's medium bodied with plush fruit, sinewy tannins and plenty of oak influence. Give this time to emerge out of an awkward phase. It should cellar nicely until 2026."
Château Lescalle 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),Château Lescalle,Rose,,Rosé,"Bordeaux Rosé, Bordeaux, France",12.5%,$10,83,Roger Voss,"Very pale, almost white in color, this wine is flat and lacks fruit. A touch of spice helps. Drink now."
Le Due Torri 2009 Pinot Grigio (Venezia Giulia),Le Due Torri,White,,Pinot Grigio,"Venezia Giulia, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13%,$10,85,,"Easy, fresh and well-priced, this luminous Pinot Grigio would pair with appetizers or cheese platters. The wine shows bright aromas of citrus, pear and peach and there's a spicy, zesty tone on the close."
Paolo Manzone 2010 Meriame  (Barolo),Paolo Manzone,Red,Meriame,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$80,92,Kerin O’Keefe,"This displays primary aromas of black fruit along with whiffs of roasted herbs and espresso. The palate offers black plum, prune and Morello cherry accented by black pepper, coffee, toast and vanilla. Youthfully aggressive and tightly packed, this needs time to fully develop. Drink after 2022."
Morgan 2007 Double L Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Morgan,Red,Double L Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$48,92,,"A big, thick, heavy Pinot Noir, showing the ripe flavors that a good Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noir usually has. Floods the mouth with raspberry and cherry pie filling, currants, red plums, cola and rhubarbs. Nothing shy about it. Good now with lamb chops or a nice steak, and should do interesting things over the next six years."
Château Haut-Rian 2018 Sélection Parcellaire  (Côtes de Bordeaux),Château Haut-Rian,Red,Sélection Parcellaire,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Côtes de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",14%,$19,88,Roger Voss,"Produced from selected parcels in the vineyard, this wine has generous richness. Bold tannins partner with ripe blackberry fruits in a blend of Merlot with Cabernet Sauvignon. The dry core means it needs to age. Drink from 2022."
General Bilimoria 2003 Olifants River Red (Olifants River),General Bilimoria,Red,Olifants River,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Olifants River, South Africa",13.5%,$8,80,,"Dry and failry thin, with a tart edge. The Pinotage fruit must be potent since it seems to outweigh the predominant (76%) Shiraz here. Sour on the finish."
David Hill 2019 Estate Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),David Hill,White,Estate,,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.4%,$22,92,Paul Gregutt,"Scented with a fresh sea breeze saltiness, this is an elegant wine with mineral highlights around light fruit flavors of kumquat and other citrus. Despite the overall elegance, the flavors persist deep into the palate and through the finish, with a refreshing trail of wet stone. It was aged in a 50-50 mix of oval oak cask and stainless steel."
Hudson-Chatham 2011 Empire Reserve Red (New York),Hudson-Chatham,Red,Empire Reserve,"Red Blends, Red Blends","New York, New York Other, New York, US",12%,$25,85,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Ruddy, primary red cherry and berry notes persist from nose to finish on this blend of Baco Noir, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Ripe black-fruit flavors are fleshy and ripe on the palate, but demure in concentration and length."
Antonio Lopes Ribeiro 2012 Red (Douro),Antonio Lopes Ribeiro,Red,,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",14%,$18,88,Roger Voss,"Grown in the schist terraces of the Douro, this wine is a Touriga Franca-dominated blend. Thyme and eucalyptus flavors are balanced by richly structured red berry fruit and tannins. It will be ready from 2018."
Lumen 2015 Presqu'ile Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),Lumen,Red,Presqu'ile Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.52%,$62,93,Matt Kettmann,"This bottling by Lane Tanner, who used solely clone 667 and employed 50% new Hungarian oak, offers intense cherry on the nose alongside rose petals, carnations, preserved oranges and North African spice. There's bountiful energy to the sip, where bay leaf, thyme and green sage meet with dark red fruit."
Testarossa 2013 Novitiate Late Harvest Syrah (Chalone),Testarossa,Dessert,Novitiate Late Harvest,,"Chalone, Central Coast, California, US",16.7%,$27,89,Matt Kettmann,"Rather reserved in aromas for a dessert wine, this allows blackberry, black pepper and mineral notes to emerge with time. The palate is lightly sweet, with ripe blackberry and blueberry-jam flavors, made interesting with a pencil-lead minerality throughout."
Azalea Springs 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Azalea Springs,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.7%,$70,93,,"Smells and tastes just great, with all the hallmarks of an important Napa Cabernet. It's rich in blackberries, black currants, cassis and minerals. Near- perfect tannins and a tasteful overlay of sweet oak add textural complexity. For all that, the wine feels young and brusque. It wants 6–7 years of age to begin to strut its stuff. Open after 2012."
Rive Della Chiesa NV Spumante Extra Dry Prosecco (Montello e Colli Asolani),Rive Della Chiesa,Sparkling,Spumante Extra Dry,"Prosecco, Sparkling","Montello e Colli Asolani, Veneto, Italy",11%,$14,87,Joe Czerwinski,"Austere and minerally on the nose, with hints of yeastiness and citrus. This is much less fruity and floral than most Proseccos, yielding instead flavors of stones and limes. The slightly chalky finish is clean and refreshing."
R. Stuart & Co. NV Bubbly Sparkling (Oregon),R. Stuart & Co.,Sparkling,Bubbly,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",11%,$28,86,Paul Gregutt,"Tasted in September 2019, this nonvintage brut is a 50-50 blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc. Made in the Champagne method, it's foamy and tart, with sharp notes of grapefruit and lemon rind. It finishes with residual bitterness."
Viña Mayor 2012 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),Viña Mayor,Red,Reserva,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$26,88,Michael Schachner,"Full, round aromas of berry fruits are oaky and appealing. In the mouth, this wine is ultradry, tannic and raw. Flavors of blackberry, plum and coffee finish hard and abrasive due to scraping tannins."
Cinnabar 2012 Zhu Sha Red (Clements Hills),Cinnabar,Red,Zhu Sha,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Clements Hills, Central Valley, California, US",14.9%,$34,90,Jim Gordon,"This blend of Barbera, Petite Sirah and other red varieties tastes hearty, fruity, full flavored and full bodied, without being too tannic to enjoy easily. Aromas like blackberry jam and flavors reminiscent of dark plum and spicy, smoky oak make it tempting and delicious. Enough fresh acidity keeps it balanced."
Rally Point Wines 2013 Limited Production Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Rally Point Wines,White,Limited Production,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$38,88,Virginie Boone,"Dark hay in color with a concentration of oak on the nose, the palate retains that richness of nutty almond and apple pie, finding a balance that betrays the heavier implications of the initial aromas. On the finish it offers a lightness of being, as well as a touch of perfume."
Brown Brothers 2000 Patricia Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Victoria),Brown Brothers,Red,Patricia Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Victoria, Victoria, Australia",14.3%,$30,88,,"Black as black in color, which may or may not have anything to do with the 7% Petit Verdot inside. It's a straight-up plum-and-oak combo, dense in the mouth with tealike tannins that linger on the finish."
Meadow View 2018 Mary Leigh's Vineyard Jon's Vineyard Chardonnay (Lamorinda),Meadow View,White,Mary Leigh's Vineyard Jon's Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Lamorinda, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$20,88,Jim Gordon,"Medium bodied and nicely complex, this well-balanced wine offers hints of butter and fig in the aroma, crisp apple and Bosc pear on the palate and a texture livened by a snap of tartness."

There's also a cedary element to the nose and palate. Otherwise, look for full-force wild berry and cassis flavors and a smooth, clean finish. Nothing awkward or forced; Doña Paula's best Malbec ever. Drink now through 2013."
Colutta 2006 Picolit (Colli Orientali del Friuli),Colutta,Dessert,,"Picolit, Italian White","Colli Orientali del Friuli, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13.5%,$19,89,,"Closed with a wax- top bottle, this elegant Picolit offers pretty aromas of honey-roasted chestnut and dried lavender.

Hall 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Hall,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.1%,$24,91,Virginie Boone,"A woody, toasted note speaks to well-integrated yet present oak in this white that maintains medium-bodied texture on the palate. Bright, lemony acidity complements the creaminess, dashing in wet stone and undeniable floral notes of apple and orange blossom."
Frey-Sohler 2018 Brise d'Eté Rosé (Alsace),Frey-Sohler,Rose,Brise d'Eté,Rosé,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$19,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Summer berry compote and mellow, creamy apple notes combine on the nose of this wine. The palate reprises these notes and adds a smidgeon of phenolic grip. It's a mellow, rounded but fresh and dry wine."
Cline 2015 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Cline,Red,Estate Grown,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14%,$15,84,Virginie Boone,"Dark color and a punch of smoky oak underline this wine's big burly hold of tannin and ripe fruit.

Iijima,"Smoky tones of charred brioche and hazelnut biscotti accent bright, juicy black plum and cassis in this medium-bodied, fresh-fruited blend of 85% Grenache and 15% Syrah.

The bright, elegant palate displays lemon, lime and walnut alongside vibrant acidity. A mineral vein underscores the savory flavors. Drink now or hold another two or three years for more complexity."
Messina Hof NV Dry Style Rosé (Texas),Messina Hof,Rose,Dry Style,Rosé,"Texas, Texas, US",11%,$6,84,Fiona Adams,"This canned rosé begs for outdoor concerts or poolside sipping. There is enough acidity to cut through the full, viscous palate, loaded with a strawberry daiquiri flavor. While not cloying, it is decidedly sugary and lingers on a ripe strawberry note."
Domaine Monthelie-Douhairet 1999 Clos Le Meix Garnier Monopole  (Monthélie),Domaine Monthelie-Douhairet,Red,Clos Le Meix Garnier Monopole,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Monthélie, Burgundy, France",13%,$26,87,,"Firmly structured, with a smooth mouthfeel and a long finish, this wine needs a few years to relax its tightly wound core of black cherries. Right now, what's showing is mostly spicy, briary notes."
Triacca 2014 Bello Stento  (Chianti Classico),Triacca,Red,Bello Stento,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$16,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"This straightforward informal red offers aromas of dark berry and moist soil.

There's a touch of acidity on the close to keep the palate refreshed."
Kabaj 2006 Cuvée Morel Red (Goriska Brda),Kabaj,Red,Cuvée Morel,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,,12.5%,$40,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A noble tribute to his Bordeaux training, winemaker Jean Michel Morel's namesake blend is beautifully concentrated with rich, sweet black fruit, with hints of violet, savory mushroom, cured meat and clay. A textured and powerful wine with vibrant acidity, it finishes long, with a swathe of velvety tannins."
Yalumba 2009 FSW8B Botrytis - 375 ml Viognier (Wrattonbully),Yalumba,Dessert,FSW8B Botrytis - 375 ml,Viognier,"Wrattonbully, South Australia, Australia",11%,$19,92,Joe Czerwinski,"Yalumba's mastery of Viognier extends even to this botrytis-affected dessert style, which offers scents and flavors of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's not overly complex, but wonderfully concentrated yet balanced, with a long, honeyed finish. Drink it over the next few years."
Schramsberg 2009 Reserve Sparkling (North Coast),Schramsberg,Sparkling,Reserve,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","North Coast, North Coast, California, US",13.3%,$120,96,Jim Gordon,"Distinctive aromas of toasted nut and wood-smoke give this full-bodied wine an exotic start, while baked apple, browned walnut and crisp cherry flavors continue the theme. Made from 82% Pinot Noir and 18% Chardonnay, it offers layers of spice, smoke and mild, savory mushroom and tea flavors, surrounded by a plush, creamy texture and light acidity to keep it fresh. Best after 2023."

The wine is muscular, yet sleek, showing the elegance of this grape variety as well as its effusiveness."
Barrister 2011 Klipsun Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Red Mountain),Barrister,White,Klipsun Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$19,92,Paul Gregutt,"An excellent follow-up to the luscious 2010, this features a generous array of melon, citrus and light tropical fruits. There is noticeable residual sugar—much in the style of the Sancerres from French producer Cotat—but at one-third the cost."
Marques de Griñon 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dominio de Valdepusa),Marques de Griñon,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dominio de Valdepusa, Central Spain, Spain",,$40,88,Michael Schachner,"Toasty and solid, with wintergreen on the nose. Blackberry, cherry and other typical Cab flavors work well together on the framed, tannic palate. Finishes ripe, with additional tannins, coffee and chocolate. Hard as a rock in terms of feel. Imported by Moët Hennessy USA."

Domaine Comte Georges de Voguë 2000  Chambolle-Musigny,Domaine Comte Georges de Voguë,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Chambolle-Musigny, Burgundy, France",,$100,90,Roger Voss,"Made from the estate's young vines and from a tiny parcel in the premier cru Les Baudes, this is still a wine with great presence. The aromas of new wood and sweet fruit show through as flavors of vanilla and rich, dark plums and raspberry jelly. The finishing acidity leaves a clean, fresh taste."
Henry Estate 2014 Müller-Thurgau (Umpqua Valley),Henry Estate,White,,"Müller-Thurgau, Other White","Umpqua Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",12.5%,$15,88,Paul Gregutt,"The spritz you see in the glass translates into a tongue-tickling experience in the mouth. Fresh flavors of orange, grapefruit and pineapple are supported with moderate acidity. This is not a sparkling wine, but you'll want to drink this while it retains that refreshing hint of fizz."
Domaine de la Verde 2015 Prélude Red (Vacqueyras),Domaine de la Verde,Red,Prélude,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Vacqueyras, Rhône Valley, France",14%,$22,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Prélude is this producer's entry-level red. But unadorned by oak, it's a transparent and luminous expression of pristine black fruit and heady floral perfume. Cherry and plum flavors are lusciously concentrated, accented by violet, spice and baked earth. A silky yet briskly balanced wine with fine, integrated tannins that extend on the finish. Enjoy now–2026."
Tussock Jumper 2020 Chardonnay (Vin de France),Tussock Jumper,White,,Chardonnay,"Vin de France, France Other, France",12.5%,$12,86,Fiona Adams,"The nose on this wine blends lemon, grapefruit peel and ripe peach. Juicy with pear and Key lime, the palate ends on tart, ripe lemon. Acidity is sharp, with a tugging finish. The wine has a green edge, but the fruit is just ripe enough."
Pedroncelli 2012 Mother Clone Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),Pedroncelli,Red,Mother Clone,Zinfandel,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.8%,$17,89,Virginie Boone,"Blended with 8% Petite Sirah and then aged almost a year in American oak, 30% of it new, this is fruity and smoky in equal measure. Its tones of blackberry, leather and black pepper are harmonious. Round and soft, it's easy to drink and will be approachable to a variety of palates."
Canon de Sol 2000 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Canon de Sol,Red,,Merlot,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$24,87,Paul Gregutt,"Fresh, lush ripe red fruits are displayed against some barrel flavors of cracker and vanilla wafer. Forward, plump and quite pleasant."
Rozes NV 40-year old tawny  (Port),Rozes,Port/Sherry,40-year old tawny,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",,$120,83,Roger Voss,A very old wine which smells medicinal and tastes like sweet cough syrup. It's so concentrated as to be almost undrinkable.
Domaine les Capréoles 2015 Diaclase  (Régnié),Domaine les Capréoles,Red,Diaclase,Gamay,"Régnié, Beaujolais, France",14%,$22,91,Roger Voss,"Made from the Domaine's oldest vines, this is a generous concentrated wine.

It impresses in its balance and length."
Torii Mor 2015 Nysa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Torii Mor,Red,Nysa Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.8%,$60,87,Paul Gregutt,"Though riper than the last vintage tasted (2013), this wine is affected from the sameness that runs through virtually all of the winery's many vineyard selections. Clearly a stylistic choice, it's acidic, bone dry, earthy and stocked with green, leafy flavors over and above the light hints of berry."
Envy 2008 Bee Bee's Blend Red (Calistoga),Envy,Red,Bee Bee's Blend,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Calistoga, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$48,92,,"A great, complex wine for drinking now with roasts and stews. Smoothly tannic, it's big, yet dry and subtle, showing flavors of blackberries, raspberries and cherries, with a delightful minerality. The sweet finish is long, rich and spicy."
Colinas do Douro 2016 Quinta da Extrema Edicão II Red (Douro),Colinas do Douro,Red,Quinta da Extrema Edicão II,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",14%,$56,94,Roger Voss,"This is a rich, complex wine, with powerful tannins along with equally impressive black plum fruits. It has richness to go with its structure and great fruits to balance the mineral texture. The blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca will age further. Drink from late 2021."
Tenuta Santavenere 2012  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Tenuta Santavenere,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$18,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"A blend of Sangiovese, 5% Merlot and 5% Colorino, this opens with subtle aromas of red currant, brown cooking spice and a whiff of sun-baked earth. The straightforward, accessible palate offers wild cherry, coffee, toasted oak and black pepper. Drink through 2018."
Felix Solis 2014 Viña Albali Gran Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas),Felix Solis,Red,Viña Albali Gran Reserva,Tempranillo,"Valdepeñas, Central Spain, Spain",14.5%,$15,85,Michael Schachner,"Leafy aromas are low on fruit and high in grit. This Tempranillo from central Spain feels racy and rough. Plum, currant, cherry and earthy spice notes fill out the flavor profile, while mulled plum and berry notes ride out on a warm finish."
Lionel Osmin & Cie 2017 Villa Grand Cap Gros Manseng (Vin de France),Lionel Osmin & Cie,White,Villa Grand Cap,"Gros Manseng, Other White","Vin de France, France Other, France",12.5%,$12,88,Lauren Buzzeo,"Slightly round and opulent in style, this opens with attractive scents of yellow apple, honeydew, guava and passion fruit. The medium-weight palate offers a slightly creamy sensation thanks to waves of ripe pear, peach and melon. Ample acidity lends balance and lift to the close."
Le Cadeau 2006 Côte Est Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Le Cadeau,Red,Côte Est,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$47,92,Paul Gregutt,"The Côte Est Pinot Noir is more structured and less immediately accessible than the winery's Rocheux bottling, but ultimately may prove to be the better bottle. It offers tightly woven, chewy fruit flavors of black cherry, black raspberry and plum, along with darker streaks of clove, leaf, smoke and earth. As always, the wine is structured with elegant precision."
Château Teyssier 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),Château Teyssier,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,90,Roger Voss,"89–91. Barrel sample. Ripe and smoky in character, this wine is perfumed and lively with acidity. It has potential to be a delicious, fruity, friendly wine but tannins and minerality both add firmer depth."
Dunnewood 2002 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),Dunnewood,Red,,Zinfandel,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",,$9,85,,"This is the kind of Zin that goes well with just about anything, from salmon to burgers. It's dry and balanced, with good flavors of berries, coffee and spices."
Domaines Schlumberger 2013 Saering Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Domaines Schlumberger,White,Saering Grand Cru,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$30,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The nose is subdued at first but then opens up into ripe apple notes with the zesty spice of grapefruit rind. The palate is dry and concentrated and adds a riper notion of juicy yellow plum while a bright lemony citrus streak keeps everything taut and lively. This is joyful, subtle and fresh and finishes on a pure apple note."
Barkan 2017 Winemakers' Choice Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee),Barkan,Red,Winemakers' Choice,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Galilee, Israel",13.5%,$20,89,Mike DeSimone,"Dark ruby in the glass, this wine offers aromas of cassis and toffee. It is round on the palate, with silky tannins and flavors of black cherry, cranberry and butterscotch. A soft note of salinity graces the finish."
Markowitsch 2003 Rosenberg Red (Carnuntum),Markowitsch,Red,Rosenberg,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Carnuntum, Austria",,,93,Roger Voss,"This is Markowitsch's flagship wine, from the Rosenberg vineyard. The blend varies from year to year, but always includes at least 50% Zweigelt, along with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. This 2003 is as powerful and intense as is to be expected from a wine of this vintage, but is saved by its structure. It is rich, ripe and very open, with damson, black currants and creamy wood flavors blending well together."
Szigeti NV Brut Grüner Veltliner (Österreichischer Sekt),Szigeti,Sparkling,Brut,Grüner Veltliner,"Österreichischer Sekt, Austria",12%,,87,Roger Voss,"An enticing apple aroma sets the scene for a fresh, crisp and deliciously refreshing sparkling wine. It preserves the natural acidity of the Grüner Veltliner, while adding a literally bubbly character, breezy, perfect for an apéritif."
Ilsley 2004 Single Vineyard Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Ilsley,Red,Single Vineyard Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Stags Leap District, Napa, California, US",14.9%,$55,92,,"This is the kind of wine the late, great André Tchelistcheff described as an iron fist in a velvet glove. The glove is the lush, forward blackberry, currant and cocoa flavors, the smooth texture and the seductively sweet new oak. The fist is the sheer power. This is an important addition to the pantheon of Stags Leap Cabernet Sauvignon, and one that needs some time in the cellar."
Conspire 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),Conspire,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Rutherford, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$28,81,,"The winery's Rutherford-grown Sauvignon Blanc needs warm vintages to ripen. The last time that happened was in 2009. The last three years have not been kind, and 2012 was chilliest yet, resulting in a wine that's green and lean."
Maryhill 2014 Kiona Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),Maryhill,Red,Kiona Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.8%,$45,87,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine's bright raspberry jam, pencil lead and barrel spice aromas lead to quite ripe, dried out fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins are a bit drying."
Byron Blatty 2016 Agenda Syrah (Los Angeles County),Byron Blatty,Red,Agenda,,"Los Angeles County, South Coast, California, US",13.7%,$58,91,Matt Kettmann,"This newer winery is one of the most promising Los Angeles County wine projects. This bottling, which includes 15% Tannat, shows cassis, black cherry and crushed purple flowers on the nose, while the palate is loaded with Morello cherry, rounded brown sugar and maple and a pleasantly chalky tannic structure."
Mumm Cuvée Napa NV Brut Prestige  (Napa Valley),Mumm Cuvée Napa,Sparkling,Brut Prestige,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",12.5%,$18,87,,"Nicely balanced with a blend of toasty-yeasty and fresh elements on the nose, this sparkler has good fruit—not too sweet—and a smooth and creamy feel. Straightforward, it offers full but dry apple-pineapple flavors and some green-apple and lime notes on the finish."
Mt. Monster 2016 Shiraz (Limestone Coast),Mt. Monster,Red,,,"Limestone Coast, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$15,85,Christina Pickard,"This is quite reductive at first, with sweaty, barnyard aromas dominating. With time in the glass and plenty of vigorous swirling, these notes do blow off, offering in their place ripe plum and cherry fruit, chocolate and a little black pepper. The palate is full and juicy with drying, slightly astringent tannins and a finish that feels a little sour fruited."
Canyon Road 2003 Chardonnay (California),Canyon Road,White,,Chardonnay,"California, California Other, California, US",,$10,84,,"Has all the elements of a top Chard, from the ripe fruit to the oak. It's just a little more modest, and a lot less expensive."
Nicodemi 2018 Le Murate  (Trebbiano d'Abruzzo),Nicodemi,White,Le Murate,"Trebbiano, Italian White","Trebbiano d'Abruzzo, Central Italy, Italy",12.5%,$15,89,Alexander Peartree,"Aromas of ripe apple and yellow plum are dappled with an inviting dried chamomile accent on the nose. The medium-bodied palate is rounded and creamy in feel, displaying juicy orchard fruit flavors honed by fresh lemon and plum skin accents."
Valserrano 2011 Finca Monteviejo  (Rioja),Valserrano,Red,Finca Monteviejo,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",15%,$45,92,Michael Schachner,"A combination of very ripe fruit and charred oak results in aromas of blackberry, prune, raisin and burnt toast. In the mouth, this is saturated and rich, with structured tannins. Roasted black-fruit flavors are savory and show sweet notes of baking spices, while this finishes with density and lingering grip. Drink from 2019–2028."
Benton-Lane 2016 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Benton-Lane,White,,,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$18,91,Paul Gregutt,"This wine's potent grass and grapefruit scents greet you, and similar flavors follow. It would be easy to mistake this for New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, given its intensity and aroma. In the mouth, it's immaculately fresh and crisp, with steely acidity. Citrus rind flavors continue through its long finish."
J. Lohr 2007 Fog's Reach Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),J. Lohr,Red,Fog's Reach Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Arroyo Seco, Central Coast, California, US",15.1%,$35,87,,"Very ripe and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling cherries and raspberries, with a rich seasoning of cinnamon, brown sugar and cocoa. But it's technically dry, and has a crispness from fine Arroyo Seco acidity. Drink now."
Carlson Creek 2012 Sangiovese (Cochise County),Carlson Creek,Red,,Sangiovese,"Cochise County, Arizona, US",13.2%,$23,84,Alexander Peartree,"An herbal strawberry aroma meets dusty furniture and dried hay on the nose. Light bodied and showing little tannic structure, flavors of watery strawberry and currant race to the finish."
Granite Heights 2010 Evening Serenade Red (Virginia),Granite Heights,Red,Evening Serenade,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Virginia, Virginia, US",13.7%,$41,85,Carrie Dykes,"Aromas of Cran-Grape juice, cherry stones and stalkiness lead into a vegetal palate. There are also some nice cedar and baking spice notes. The tannins are grippy in this full-bodied wine, while the finish is long and dry, with green notes on the back."
Owl Ridge 2012 Tyto Red (Alexander Valley),Owl Ridge,Red,Tyto,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.8%,$18,88,Virginie Boone,"Soft, layered and reasonably complex, this red blend showcases juicy black cherry, cassis and a wealth of dried herb. A good value for the quality, it'll serve a gathering well, or do its job as a weekday wine."
Penfolds 2007 Thomas Hyland Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),Penfolds,Red,Thomas Hyland,Cabernet Sauvignon,"South Australia, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$15,89,Joe Czerwinski,"Good luck finding a Cabernet for $15 that offers as much as this one does. It's filled with plums and cassis, accented by vanilla, coffee and chocolate notes. Ample weight and density are balanced by supple tannins. Should be fairly long-lived for a wine at this price; drink now–2020."
Dry Creek Vineyard 2003 Dry Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg),Dry Creek Vineyard,White,Dry,Chenin Blanc,"Clarksburg, Central Valley, California, US",,$9,85,,"Always a benchmark for bone-dry Chenins, this year's release is fragrant with peach, wildflower and vanilla, and a slightly sour flavor of lemondrop. It's so high in acidity, it practically tingles."
Tornatore 2014 Pietrarizzo  (Etna),Tornatore,Red,Pietrarizzo,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Etna, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",14.5%,$27,92,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas that recall red berry, dark baking spice and grilled Mediterranean herb lift out of the glass. The elegantly structured palate shows black cherry, wild strawberry, licorice, cracked pepper and a hint of sage. It's nicely balanced, with bright acidity and refined tannins. Drink 2019 through 2024."
Red Knot 2003 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Red Knot,Red,,,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",13.8%,$12,87,,"Cinnamon-clove aromas on the nose. The wine has dry tannins in the mouth, and very solid, taut cherry and plum fruit, with dusty pencil-eraser accents. Would pair well with grilled food, or just about anything in barbecue sauce."
Llopart 2010 Leopardi Brut Nature Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava),Llopart,Sparkling,Leopardi Brut Nature Gran Reserva,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Cava, Catalonia, Spain",11.5%,$35,90,Michael Schachner,"In a small field of excellent Cavas, this bready, leesy, semi-rich bottling stands out for its totality and comfort on the palate. Along the road are aromas of burnt banana and toasted bread along with flavors of arugula, lime and dried apple. An elegant finish with stone-fruit and green-herb notes is sophisticated."
Château Hellha 2002 3 Puttonyos Aszú  (Tokaji),Château Hellha,Dessert,3 Puttonyos Aszú,"Tokaji, White Blend","Tokaji, Hungary",12%,$20,87,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This off-dry, honeyed Tokaj wine has a penetrating minerality that extends from start to finish, with aromas of honeysuckle and fresh tangerine skin. Slightly dusty on the palate, it shows hints of dried herb and crushed stone, and it finishes on a delicate flower tone."
Chateau La Tour Carnet 2018  Haut-Médoc,Chateau La Tour Carnet,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Haut-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",14%,$39,93,Roger Voss,"The vineyards surrounding the 12th-century castle have produced this rich and densely structured wine. Powerful tannins give a smoky character to the ripe, black-plum fruits. It definitely needs aging, so drink from 2026."
Renwood 2008 Grandmère Zinfandel (Amador County),Renwood,Red,Grandmère,Zinfandel,"Amador County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",15.5%,$35,89,Virginie Boone,"Renwood's classic, Grandmère, has an inviting blackberry and sassafras nose with great fruit intensity though it's still smooth—maybe the influence of American oak?—and well-structured, monstrously full-bodied and a little moody at the finish."
Domaine Ostertag 2017 Les Vieilles Vignes Sylvaner (Alsace),Domaine Ostertag,White,Les Vieilles Vignes,"Sylvaner, Other White","Alsace, Alsace, France",12%,$30,90,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Touches of earth and straw appear on the nose but lemon also shines through. This wine shows a lovely juxtaposition of textured, ripe juiciness and vivid freshness, presented on a fresh and Mirabelle-scented body. It finishes dry."
Donnachadh 2017 Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),Donnachadh,Red,,,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$45,94,Matt Kettmann,"Bloody meats, squid ink, black raspberry, crushed rocks and char show on the nose of this bottling.

Sterling 1998 Merlot (Napa Valley),Sterling,Red,,Merlot,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.5%,$23,83,,"Here's a wine that just cannot overcome the limitations of the vintage. They tried for extract and gave it some pretty oak but nonetheless herbal, bell pepper characteristics overshadow its modest berry fruit."
Klipfel 2009 Clos Zisser Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),Klipfel,Dessert,Clos Zisser Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru,"Gewürztraminer, Gewürztraminer","Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$30,91,Roger Voss,"Certainly sweet, this is a rich wine that is maturing well.

Christoph Edelbauer 2016 Zweigelt (Niederösterreich),Christoph Edelbauer,Red,,"Zweigelt, Other Red","Niederösterreich, Austria",13.5%,$26,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A spicy hint of maple syrup precedes the vivid red cherry fruit on the nose. The palate then adds a lovely, slightly smoky oakiness to the elegant, fresh and sinuous palate. This has a lovely coolness about it, a slender elegance accentuated by very fine, tulle tannins."
Kangarilla Road 2015 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills),Kangarilla Road,White,,Chardonnay,"Adelaide Hills, South Australia, Australia",13.5%,$25,88,Joe Czerwinski,"This McLaren Vale-based winery reaches into the neighboring Adelaide Hills for its Chardonnay. This is subtly oaky, hinting at toast and butter, then pulling back to reveal understated apple and citrus flavors that are clean and refreshing on the finish."
Stags' Leap Winery 2000 Estate Grown Reserve Merlot (Napa Valley),Stags' Leap Winery,Red,Estate Grown Reserve,Merlot,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.8%,$50,91,,"A wonderful Merlot. It's very soft in the mouth; the blackberry, cherry and plum flavors are not especially dense, probably because of the vintage. But the tannins are as softly blurry as Renoir colors. This is an early drinker of immense charm."
Beaulieu Vineyard 2006 Beaulieu Reserve Maestro Collection No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Beaulieu Vineyard,Red,Beaulieu Reserve Maestro Collection No. 1,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rutherford, Napa, California, US",14.8%,$65,92,,"With this Bordeaux blend, Beaulieu seems to be striving to create a softer, fruiter wine than their various Cabernets. They have succeeded. The wine is generous in blackberries, cherries and blueberries, with a strong coating of sweet, smoky oak. Plush and lovely now, and should develop bottle complexity through 2012."
Tapestry 1999 Bin 338 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Tapestry,Red,Bin 338,,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",13.5%,$25,87,,"The nose on the Tapestry is a little subdued—but that's a good thing, if brett, garlic and meaty gravy aren't what you're looking for in a Shiraz. Medium-weight and a little chewy in the mouth, the palate offers lots of blackberry plus earth, leather and horsey flavors. Finishes medium-long with grape and oak flavors."
Seven Daughters 2012 Crisp White (California),Seven Daughters,White,Crisp,White Blend,"California, California Other, California, US",13.5%,$13,83,,"True to its name, this blend is tangy in acidity.

Built upon firm, cherry-berry fruit, it adds nuances of baking spice, pepper, vanilla wafer and a pleasing earthiness to the tannins. It represents the ultimate expression of Columbia Crest, and the 2005 marks a welcome return to excellence."
Core Winery 2005 Elevation Sensation Red (Santa Barbara County),Core Winery,Red,Elevation Sensation,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",15.1%,$42,83,,"Overripe and hot, with a Porty, brandied fruitcake aroma and semi-sweet cherry and chocolate flavors.

The palate is a bit tart and tangy for Malbec, with mid-level berry flavors and a shot of tartness. Not overly ripe or happy, but with touches of quality."

Kaena 2015 Larner Vineyard Grenache (Ballard Canyon),Kaena,Red,Larner Vineyard,Grenache,"Ballard Canyon, Central Coast, California, US",15.3%,$52,94,Matt Kettmann,"Mikael Sigouin extracts the rich side of Grenache in most of his bottlings, and this is an excellent example. Deep and stunning aromas of lilac, cola, red cherries, strawberry-balsamic glaze, black cardamom and sharp sandalwood lead into a palate that's lavish with chai spice, dried ginger and cherry-cordial flavors. Tannins pile up toward the finish and the acidity sings through it all."
Adrás 2014 Godello (Ribeira Sacra),Adrás,White,,"Godello, Spanish White","Ribeira Sacra, Galicia, Spain",12.5%,$19,88,Michael Schachner,"Pear, melon and stony mineral aromas share space on the nose of this Godello, which feels solid.

This reserve-level holdover from 2004 offers mint, chocolate and leather aromas in front of ripe cherry and raspberry flavors. Almost crisp and choppy, but on the other hand precise and zesty. Not unlike a very good Dolcetto from Italy."
Jaxon 2016 Grenache (Rogue Valley),Jaxon,Red,,Grenache,"Rogue Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",13.8%,$32,89,Paul Gregutt,"Spicy and detailed, the mix of cranberry, pomegranate and raspberry fruit carries this wine through a firm, medium-bodied finish.

It opens with aromas of plump blueberries, plums, chocolate flakes, dried green spices and black pepper, with flecks of licorice and graphite in the background. There's some heat from the alcohol on the palate and the oak is fairly prominent. Spicy, drying tannins back more plush plummy fruit. This should cellar well, but it's a little chunky at the moment. Drink 2020–2029."
Gloria Ferrer 1997 Pinot Noir (Carneros),Gloria Ferrer,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$20,85,,"Aromas of cherries with orange-peel notes and a touch of funky earthiness that adds depth and interest.

It captures the essence of young, fresh, spicy Syrah, unadulterated or modified with other grapes. This is tight, firm, sappy, young and a bit relentless in a tough, confident style. Flavors of cranberry and wild raspberry run rampant, with plenty of acid to keep it clean and penetrating."

This rich and complex wine has a fine perfumed character, laced with lemon and pear flavors. It has a touch of minerality in its texture, making a wine that should age over several years."
Bitouzet-Prieur 2016 Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),Bitouzet-Prieur,White,Charmes Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Meursault, Burgundy, France",13%,$120,91,Roger Voss,"A perfumed wine full of white fruits balanced by acidity, this is already advanced and ready to drink.

Iijima,"Notes of blackberry and crème de cassis are piercing and pristine in this concentrated blend of 40% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 20% Carignan.

McFadden 2014 Riesling (Potter Valley),McFadden,White,,Riesling,"Potter Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14.1%,$18,87,Jim Gordon,"This is a smooth and gently fruity wine.

Michelle,Red,Indian Wells,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,VivinoWine.comTotal Wine,89,Paul Gregutt,"Here at last are the flavors that have been missing from Ste. Michelle Cabs for some time. This is crisply structured, varietally spot-on Cabernet. The ripe—but not jammy—fruit flavors of blackberry and black plum are amplified with spicy cinnamon from aging in American oak. There is a hint of chalkiness in the way the acids hit the palate, but otherwise this is picture-perfect, with well-delineated tannins and some delicious Asian spices on the finish."
Château Saint-Pierre 2013  Saint-Julien,Château Saint-Pierre,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Julien, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,,87,Roger Voss,"This wine is dark and extracted, with bitter chocolate flavors as well as hints of black-currant fruit.

Valenciso deals medium-level acids and tannins, with oak-based mocha and chocolate carrying the finish. This wine is so close to reaching the next level, but it doesn't quite get there."
La Playa 2004 Estate Rose Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),La Playa,Rose,Estate Rose,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",13.5%,$8,81,Michael Schachner,"Light fruit, muddled aromas, candied flavors and a heavy aftertaste don't really add up to a lot. Yes, it's acceptable. But it's also aging quickly and won't be improving."
Willamette Valley Vineyards 2007 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Willamette Valley Vineyards,White,Estate Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$30,85,Paul Gregutt,"Soft, buttery, with microwave popcorn flavors, this needs to be well chilled or it will come off a bit flabby. Simple fruit flavors of green grapes and apples are somewhat overwhelmed by the oak."
Poderi Aldo Conterno 1998 Colonnello  (Barolo),Poderi Aldo Conterno,Red,Colonnello,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",,$116,89,,"Decidedly not a powerhouse this vintage, the '98 Colonnello is a pretty, relatively lightweight wine, displaying a range of aromas and flavors from cherries to cigarbox and dried spices. Drink now–2015."
Manos Negras 2011 Malbec (Mendoza),Manos Negras,Red,,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$15,81,Michael Schachner,"This is hard coated with a creamy plastic note and a milk chocolate scent. Overall it smells heavily oaked and artificial. It feels resiny, with sticky tannins and thickness, tasting of hickory and carob."
Kaena 2016 Kuliouou Cuvée Alamo Creek Ranch Red (San Luis Obispo County),Kaena,Red,Kuliouou Cuvée Alamo Creek Ranch,Rhône-style Red Blend,"San Luis Obispo County, Central Coast, California, US",15.6%,$40,91,Matt Kettmann,"Strong aromas of potpourri, blackberry jam, licorice and sandalwood show on the nose of this blend of 65% Grenache and 35% Syrah from a hidden vineyard north of the Santa Maria Valley. The sip is tense in structure, which frames the exuberant cassis, fig and baked licorice flavors."
Sanguis 2007 The Oracle of Delphi Syrah (California),Sanguis,Red,The Oracle of Delphi,,"California, California Other, California, US",15.8%,$85,95,,"A brilliant Syrah, showing its cool-climate origins with a burst of white pepper. Much of the fruit comes from the Bien Nacido Vineyard, and the Syrah contains 4% Viognier. Firm tannins and fine acidity give this delicious wine structure, but it's mostly notable for the extraordinary depth and length of its blackberry, currant, teriaki beef, mushroom and cedar flavors. The wine easily stands up to 100% new French oak casks."
Kenwood 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),Kenwood,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$13,83,,"A little unripe and green, with minty flavors that veer into that notorious cat zone. Has just enough lemon and lime citrus flavor to bring it back from the brink."
Cave du Marmandais 2015 Château Terrebert Malbec-Cabernet Franc Red (Côtes du Marmandais),Cave du Marmandais,Red,Château Terrebert Malbec-Cabernet Franc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Côtes du Marmandais, Southwest France, France",14%,$13,88,Roger Voss,"Structure and perfume go well together in this attractive blend of 30% Cabernet Franc and 70% Malbec. The wine, full of black fruits, plenty of acidity and a firm touch of tannins is balanced, juicy and ready to drink."
De Loach 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),De Loach,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$30,86,Virginie Boone,"Earthy compost and forest vie for attention in this full-bodied, lush wine that's lightly spiced with clove. Cranberry, strawberry and a hint of leather round out the experience."
Robert Mondavi 2012 Fumé Blanc (Napa Valley),Robert Mondavi,White,,"Fumé Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.5%,$19,88,Virginie Boone,"Inviting in tropical aromas of guava and pineapple, it smells sweet but drinks dry, balanced in melon and high-toned citrus, just a hint of grass on the finish."
Vicente Gandia 2014 Hoya de Cadenas 130 Anniversary Red (Utiel-Requena),Vicente Gandia,Red,Hoya de Cadenas 130 Anniversary,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Utiel-Requena, Levante, Spain",13%,$15,86,Michael Schachner,"Floral plum and horsey aromas comprise the nose on this multigrape blend led by Bobal.

Don Román 2004  Rioja,Don Román,Red,,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$15,85,Michael Schachner,"A bit leafy up front, with aromas of carob, forest floor and standard berry. The palate deals expected cherry and raspberry flavors, while the tight finish leaves a snappy sensation. A standard food wine."
L.A. Cetto 2001 Zinfandel (Valle de Guadalupe),L.A. Cetto,Red,,Zinfandel,,,$8,83,,"A surprisingly light, crisp Zinfandel, with tomato and herb aromas and flavors only partially offset by berries. But it finishes with Zin's trademark pepperiness."
Malavasi Daniele 2015  Lugana,Malavasi Daniele,White,,"Turbiana, Italian White","Lugana, Lombardy, Italy",13%,$19,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of banana, yellow stone fruit and a heady whiff of jasmine jump out of the glass.

Fiuza 2019 Ducado do Infante Reserva Red (Tejo),Fiuza,Red,Ducado do Infante Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Tejo, Portugal",13.5%,$16,91,Roger Voss,"A rich blend of 50-50 Touriga Nacional and Alicante Bouschet, the wine has a dense color accompanied by dense tannins and dark black fruits. Wood aging has softened the tannins although they do have a ways to go. Drink from 2022."
Trumpeter 2004 Malbec-Syrah (Tupungato),Trumpeter,Rose,,,"Tupungato, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$9,86,Michael Schachner,"Heady and well choreographed, with roasted sweet aromas to get things going.

Cordella 2013  Brunello di Montalcino,Cordella,Red,,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$90,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made with organically farmed Sangiovese, this evokes aromas of black-skinned berry, truffle and new leather.

Merriam 2000 Windacre Vineyard Merlot (Russian River Valley),Merriam,Red,Windacre Vineyard,Merlot,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$34,88,,"A first-rate wine, with well-ripened flavors of blackberries, espresso, cola, tea, and bitter chocolate, but made more interesting by fresh acidity not often seen in today's better Merlots. This cool-climate wine also has sturdy tannins that suggest mid-term aging."
Novus 2003 Syrah (Mendoza),Novus,Red,,,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$11,85,Michael Schachner,"Standard fare, but nice. The nose offers some burnt sugar in addition to black fruit, while the palate is full of plum, cherry and spice. Chocolate and vanilla are detectable on the medium-length finish, while the feel and balance are proper."
Mill Creek 2001 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Mill Creek,Red,,Zinfandel,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$22,89,,"Marked by deep, rich licorice and black cherry flavors, the wine also serves up an array of lovely plum, raspberry, coffee, cola and spice flavors. Tannins are smooth yet firm, and the finish is moderate in length."
Château Landreau 2017  Côtes de Bourg,Château Landreau,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Côtes de Bourg, Bordeaux, France",14%,$22,92,Roger Voss,"This vineyard had lain derelict after the devastating 1956 Bordeaux frosts before it was purchased in 1995. From vines now approaching peak production, this wine is structured, with dense tannins as well as generous blackberry fruits. It has a future and should be drunk from 2022."
Steven Kent 1999 Folkendt Vineyard - Merrillie Chardonnay (Livermore Valley),Steven Kent,White,Folkendt Vineyard - Merrillie,Chardonnay,"Livermore Valley, Central Coast, California, US",,$36,93,,"From a newish winery, this stunning Chard opens with lush, opulent aromas of tropical fruits and peach, lime peel, smoke, butterscotch, mineral and smoky oak. Fabulous depth and complexity in the mouth, with an almost unnatural limpidity and velvety softness."
Carivintas 2007 Hobo Petite Sirah (Santa Barbara County),Carivintas,Red,Hobo,Petite Sirah,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",15.1%,$30,85,,"Lots of blackberry, cherry, smoked meat and pepper spice flavors in this dry, tannic Petite Sirah. It's a little harsh in texture, so drink it with rich barbecue and roasted meat dishes."

The wine is ripe and forward in tangerine, apricot, mango and lime fruit, with fine acidity and a hit of buttery, toasty oak. It defines the ripe, opulent California coastal style of Chardonnay."
Allimant-Laugner 2016 Pinot Gris (Alsace),Allimant-Laugner,White,,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$18,86,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Pithy zesty notes rise from the glass. The palate has the same lifted, pithy, and slightly bitter edge but some residual sweetness rounds the pear apparent on the palate into fluid fruitiness. The bitter edge remains and the wine finishes dry."
Felton Road 2019 Cornish Point Pinot Noir (Central Otago),Felton Road,Red,Cornish Point,Pinot Noir,"Central Otago, New Zealand",13.5%,$63,92,Christina Pickard,"Using grapes from lakeside vines that are now over 20 years old, Cornish Point displays some of the most brambly fruit and secondary notes of the FR Pinots. It's quite young now, but with just a little air it starts to reveal aromas of wild blueberry, cedar, dried flowers, vanilla bean and a slight meaty undertone. The palate is fresher than the broody nose suggests, with a tug of powdery tannins and fleshy fruit, but has a broader shape than Felton's Block 3 or Calvert. Drink now–2031."
Falcor 2004 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),Falcor,Red,,Sangiovese,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.9%,$32,83,,"Falcor's previous Sangioveses both seemed underripe. This one's just the opposite, a soft, jammy wine with sweetened cherry and raspberry candy flavors."

Green-apple-flesh flavors pop on the palate with bright citrus flashes."
Domaine Seilly 2009 Rouge d'Obernai Pinot Noir (Alsace),Domaine Seilly,Red,Rouge d'Obernai,Pinot Noir,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$26,87,Roger Voss,"With some wood aging, this is a richer Pinot Noir than some from Alsace. Good color, red berry fruits and an intense juicy line of acidity. Not for aging, but with some weight."
Carica 2007 Temptation Red (Sonoma County),Carica,Red,Temptation,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",14.7%,$25,84,,"This Rhône red blend is kind of simple and sweet, offering fruit and oak flavors that go down nice and easy. Tastes like raspberry, cherry, roasted almond, honey and vanilla granola."
Tower 15 2010 The Swell Red (Paso Robles),Tower 15,Red,The Swell,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.8%,$21,83,,"A blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this is heavy, soft and fruity, delivering a blackberry flavor and a dry finish."

Wine with Spirit 2012 Carpe Noctem Voyeur Limited Edition Red (Alentejano),Wine with Spirit,Red,Carpe Noctem Voyeur Limited Edition,Portuguese Red,"Alentejano, Portugal",14%,$25,90,Roger Voss,"Put aside the bizarre name and label and concentrate on the wine which is fine, structured and densely tannic red fruit. The tannins and firm texture are balanced by black currant flavors and succulent acidity. The wine needs to age, and shouldn't be drunk before 2017."
Campus Oaks 2004 Cum Laude Reserve Petite Sirah (Clarksburg),Campus Oaks,Red,Cum Laude Reserve,Petite Sirah,"Clarksburg, Central Valley, California, US",15.4%,$20,87,,"Big, thick, rich, ripe and basically dry pretty much sums up this Delta-grown Petite Sirah. It bursts with chocolate-infused red and black currant flavors, with an edge of pepper and tobacco. Sturdy enough to hold well for a decade."
Domaine de la Jobeline 2016  Mâcon-Verze,Domaine de la Jobeline,White,,Chardonnay,"Mâcon-Verze, Burgundy, France",13.5%,,88,Roger Voss,"Mineral, crisp and full of acidity, this wine offers a tangy texture and fresh acidity.

Firestone 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Firestone,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$15,90,Matt Kettmann,"Black cherry, cocoa and turned loam aromas show on the nose.

Columbia Winery 1999 Red Willow Syrah (Yakima Valley),Columbia Winery,Red,Red Willow,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$35,90,,"Despite being a bit closed aromatically, a thick, velvety mouthfeel and dense blackberry and vanilla flavors confirm this wine's quality. With airing, burnt caramel and fleshy berry scents emerge. The finish brings a hint of pepper and some drying tannins--enough to suggest cellaring two or three years."
Viña Canchal 2003 Tempranillo (Ribera del Guadiana),Viña Canchal,Red,,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Guadiana, Central Spain, Spain",13%,$6,83,Michael Schachner,"Rosy in color, with simple jammy aromas.

Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",13.3%,$36,91,Matt Kettmann,"Fresh grapefruit and ripe apple make for a fresh and inviting nose on this blend of 36% Chardonnay, 32% Pinot Blanc and 32% Pinot Gris. Lime-pith and guava-peel flavors make for a briefly botanical twist to the palate before more tropical elements of mango emerge atop the chalky texture."
Terlato 2014 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Colli Orientali),Terlato,White,,Pinot Grigio,"Friuli Colli Orientali, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13%,$25,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of beeswax, elder flower and white orchard fruit emerge in the glass. On the lively palate, zesty acidity energizes creamy white peach, green pear and citrus while a mineral note backs up the tangy finish."
Château de Bel-Air 2006  Lalande de Pomerol,Château de Bel-Air,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Lalande de Pomerol, Bordeaux, France",13%,$30,89,Roger Voss,"A rich Merlot-driven wine, smoothly polished by new wood. Flavors of mint mingle with sweet tannins and black berry fruits. There is a fine, smoky edge as well to this wine, which would certainly benefit from 3–4 years' aging."
Robert Hall 2015 Chardonnay (Paso Robles),Robert Hall,White,,Chardonnay,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14%,$18,86,Matt Kettmann,"Sliced green pears, honeysuckle, jasmine, cut limes and a touch of apple-flavored bubblegum show on the nose of this bottling. The texture is nicely cut with steely grip, releasing flavors of sour apple, ripe nectarine and honeydew."
Horsepower 2015 The Tribe Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),Horsepower,Red,The Tribe Vineyard,,"Walla Walla Valley (OR), Oregon Other, Oregon, US",13.6%,$120,96,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas are exultant in notes of fire pit, ham hock, green olive, mineral, peat, soot, sea breeze, steak tartare, coffee bean and potpourri. The palate is full of intensely rich yet still vibrant, savory flavors and an abundant peppery tone. The olive and fire-pit finish easily lingers for a minute, if not beyond."
Albert Bichot 2003 Domaine du Pavillon Clos des Maréchaudes  (Corton),Albert Bichot,Red,Domaine du Pavillon Clos des Maréchaudes,Pinot Noir,"Corton, Burgundy, France",,$100,92,Roger Voss,"Part of the Les Maréchaudes vineyard is grand cru Corton, while the rest is simply premier cru—go figure. It just means terroir. This wine, from the grand cru portion, is dense and tannic, typical of the wine and the vineyard. There is great juicy fruit under the tannins. An ager. Imported by Eagle Eye Imports."
San Simeon 2013 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Monterey),San Simeon,White,Estate Reserve,Chardonnay,"Monterey, Central Coast, California, US",14.9%,$22,89,Matt Kettmann,"This blend of grapes from Monterey's Arroyo Seco and Santa Lucia Highlands appellations comes from the family behind Los Angeles' stalwart San Antonio Winery.

La Follette 2014 Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),La Follette,White,Sangiacomo Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",13.2%,$38,91,Virginie Boone,"This is a bright and fully textured, creamy white wine, integrated and smooth in its approach, with highlights of apple, pear and piquant nutmeg. It shows a light yet full style, awaiting pairings at the table."
Billabong 1999 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),Billabong,Red,,,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",13.5%,$8,85,,"A red berry-cherry jamball with rhubarb and herb accents. Lighter-styled, it has a slick mouthfeel, although tart, even sharp, acidity comes up on the back end. This easy drinker closes sweet yet tart, with a slight peppery tang. Best Buy."
Paolo Scavino 2014  Dolcetto d'Alba,Paolo Scavino,Red,,"Dolcetto, Italian Red","Dolcetto d'Alba, Piedmont, Italy",13%,$15,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Simple and delicious, this vibrant, mouthwatering red doles out fleshy black cherry, crushed blueberry, ground pepper and clove alongside polished tannins.

Ozzie-Ba-Ru 2007 French Oak Chardonnay (Hunter Valley),Ozzie-Ba-Ru,White,French Oak,Chardonnay,"Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia",13.7%,$17,86,Joe Czerwinski,"This wine displays plenty of weight and an unctuous texture alongside aromas and flavors of toasted nuts. There's also a strange herbal note, elements that are decidedly egg-like, and a long, honeyed finish. File it under “intriguing,” and drink it over the next several months."
Spicewood 2014 Tempranillo (Texas Hill Country),Spicewood,Red,,Tempranillo,"Texas Hill Country, Texas, US",13.3%,$40,85,Alexander Peartree,"Gamy and mildly concentrated, this Tempranillo from the Hill Country brings to mind pork fat and peppercorns on the nose.

Cartuxa 2005 Branco Colheita White (Alentejano),Cartuxa,White,Branco Colheita,Portuguese White,"Alentejano, Portugal",13.5%,,88,Roger Voss,"It's the Antão Vaz, the Chardonnay of Portugal, that gives this such class. It is full, tasty and complex, with acidity and superripeness, but still elegant white fruits. Additional richness comes from lees-stirring after fermentation, giving a fine depth of flavor."
Saintsbury 2009 Cerise Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Saintsbury,Red,Cerise Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14.5%,$45,93,,"A commanding Pinot Noir that wants a little time in the cellar. It combines power with finesse—the mark of a great wine. Dramatically packed with rich, ripe cherry, mocha and pie spice flavors, it's young and sappy now. Give it 5-6 years to knit together."
Ceja 2001 Syrah (Sonoma County),Ceja,Red,,,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",,$28,86,,"Complex, with plum, clove, oaky vanilla and grilled meat notes. Drinks very dry, with firm tannins. Shows real style in the overall balance and harmony."

Once you sample it, that fact won't at all surprise you. Plum fruit on the nose and on the palate takes a back seat to the wood; oak is all you get on the finish."
Château Nozières 2011 Ambroise de l'Her  (Cahors),Château Nozières,Red,Ambroise de l'Her,Malbec,"Cahors, Southwest France, France",14.5%,,92,Roger Voss,"This big, bold and ripe wine is packed both with tannins and concentrated, ripe fruits. It's smooth, opulent, with a burst of black berry flavors that are shaped by the firm structure. The wood aging shows as spice and smokiness, giving further richness to this powerful wine. Drink from 2018."
Giant Steps 2011 Tarraford Vineyard Chardonnay (Yarra Valley),Giant Steps,White,Tarraford Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Yarra Valley, Victoria, Australia",12.8%,$42,92,Joe Czerwinski,"Despite it's modest reported alcohol level, this is a plush, rounded example of Chardonnay, loaded with fruit.

Viberti 2014 Buon Padre  (Barolo),Viberti,Red,Buon Padre,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$55,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Wild berry, dark spice, new leather and truffle aromas take center stage along with a whiff of violet. The linear medium-bodied palate is on the racy side, offering cranberry, star anise and crushed herb alongside tight, close-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink 2019–2026."
Vinum Africa 2011 Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),Vinum Africa,White,,Chenin Blanc,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",13%,$16,87,Lauren Buzzeo,"Here's a fresh, easygoing and accessible white, with bright aromas and flavors of green plum, orange, peach and pineapple.

Brawny tannins surround substantial layers of blackberry and coffee, the feel on the palate weighty and voluptuous. Cellar through 2026."
Ronco dei Tassi 2014 Pinot Grigio (Collio),Ronco dei Tassi,White,,Pinot Grigio,"Collio, Northeastern Italy, Italy",12.5%,$20,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"White blossom and apple aromas open on this vibrant white while the racy palate shows Kaiser pear, tangerine and a hint of mineral.

The palate is full of brilliant flavors, from snappy black raspberry to more rounded strawberry sorbet, lifted by allspice, clove, vanilla and plenty of fresh acidity."
Kastania 2008 Jaden &amp; Keira's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Kastania,Red,Jaden & Keira's Cuvée,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.7%,$35,87,,"There's plenty of ripe raspberry and cherry jam flavor on this wine, highlighted with interesting cola, beef jerky, vanilla and toast notes.

Spicy plum and berry flavors come with a bell pepper note, while this feels tight and dry on a finish that's spicy and peppery."
Clos Pegase 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Clos Pegase,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.7%,$50,91,,"This Cab is in a somewhat awkward state now, poised between fresh blackberry and cherry fruit and mature notes of dried fruits and mushrooms. That tension lends it interest. The grapes come from Calistoga and Carneros, which also gives a dynamic play between lushness and acidity. It's a fine, stylish wine for drinking now–2017."
Ribafreixo 2016 Pato Frio Editon Red (Alentejano),Ribafreixo,Red,Pato Frio Editon,Portuguese Red,"Alentejano, Portugal",14%,$13,90,Roger Voss,"This lightly structured wine has perfumed, juicy red fruits and a more serious line of tannins. It is balanced and still fresh, but with a sense of maturity. The wine is a fine blend of Aragonez, Alfrocheiro and Alicante Bouschet. Drink now. The wine is suitable for vegans."
The Four Graces 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),The Four Graces,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.1%,$32,86,Paul Gregutt,"Part of the Foley Family portfolio, this wine reflects some of the challenges of the vintage.

Château la Haye 2010  Saint-Estèphe,Château la Haye,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Estèphe, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$35,89,Roger Voss,"A mint- and spice-flavored wine, this has concentrated tannins that structure the black plum and berry fruits. The flavors are rich, and the dense texture promises several years of aging."
Bel Arbor 1999 Chardonnay (California),Bel Arbor,White,,Chardonnay,"California, California Other, California, US",,$6,82,,"A $6 Chardonnay from California? Yes, but don't expect too much. There's some decent green apple and pear fruit, okay acidity, and it's clean as technology can make it. But it doesn't rise above the level of a country-style wine. They say it was partially barrel-fermented, but it's hard to detect any oak."
Domaine de Pellehaut 2016 Harmonie de Gascogne White (Côtes de Gascogne),Domaine de Pellehaut,White,Harmonie de Gascogne,White Blend,"Côtes de Gascogne, Southwest France, France",11.5%,$12,85,Roger Voss,"As with many wines from brothers Martin and Mathieu Béraut, this is a blend of many grapes. The combination produces a typical herbal grassy wine, full of tangy citrus fruit and with a touch of apricot from the Petit Manseng in the blend. Drink this now."
Domaine Alfred 2007 Chamisal Vineyards Chardonnay (Edna Valley),Domaine Alfred,White,Chamisal Vineyards,Chardonnay,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$24,85,,"Sweet and simple in vanilla custard and buttered popcorn flavors, with a blast of pineapple jam. If you like fruity sweetness, it's for you."
Hansen Cellars 2011 Viognier (Lodi),Hansen Cellars,White,,Viognier,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",13%,$15,86,Virginie Boone,"Exhaling honey-vanilla in the glass, it gives off a hint of sweetness on the quick finish. Midpalate, expect fleshy apricot and white peach flavors. Enjoy on a summer's day with spicy peanuts."
Domaine Drouhin 2002 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Domaine Drouhin,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$40,86,,"The regular DDO has plump, ripe fruit, bright and vivid, and the fresh, simple appeal of Beaujolais. What is missing is the midpalate, which falls off precipitously and never quite recovers."
Mounts 2008 La Loma Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),Mounts,Red,La Loma,Zinfandel,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",16.2%,$30,84,,"Not quite ripe, with some green, vegetal flavors alongside the blackberries and black cherries. The lack of richness accentuates the hard tannins."
Maison Bouachon 2018 Red (Vacqueyras),Maison Bouachon,Red,,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Vacqueyras, Rhône Valley, France",14.5%,$20,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Cutting red cassis acidity and firm, finely grained tannins frame this full-bodied but vibrantly balanced red. A blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah, it's a juicy, forwardly fruity sip packed with concentrated black cherry and plum flavors. Best enjoyed now–2023."
Domaine Edmond Cornu 2014  Chorey-lès-Beaune,Domaine Edmond Cornu,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Chorey-lès-Beaune, Burgundy, France",13%,,88,Roger Voss,"This wine is fruity and ripe with fresh red-berry fruits and layers of smoky tannins. Those tannins will open up to give a rich, juicy and spicy wine from 2018."
Fontefico 2019 La Carnaglia Superiore Pecorino (Abruzzo),Fontefico,White,La Carnaglia Superiore,"Pecorino, Italian White","Abruzzo, Central Italy, Italy",14.5%,$25,88,Alexander Peartree,"The nose doesn't give much away, yielding hints of dried flowers, lemon peel and crushed stone after time in the glass. The full-bodied palate is oily in texture, with latent acidity perking things up on the midpalate. For all that weight, it ends a bit short, but still shows a mix of body and fruit that many will enjoy."
Château Lynch-Moussas 2012 Barrel Sample  (Pauillac),Château Lynch-Moussas,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France",,,92,Roger Voss,91–93. Barrel sample. There's a dry character to this wine. It's concentrated in tannins with a bitterness that leads to a new-wood and spice character. The fruit is still in the background here.
Dr. Loosen 2010 Erdener Treppchen Auslese Riesling (Mosel),Dr. Loosen,White,Erdener Treppchen Auslese,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",7.5%,VivinoGary's WineTotal Wine,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Lemon cream, spice and lanolin notes add a mysterious veil to this delicate yet intensely concentrated Riesling. It's sweet on the palate with ripe, honeyed citrus, and a delicious mineral oil sheen that lengthens the palate."
Château Grand Boise 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire),Château Grand Boise,Rose,,Rosé,"Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire, Provence, France",12.5%,$24,91,Roger Voss,"Made from organic grapes, this estate wine from the high-altitude property is crisp and tightly fruity. It boasts great acidity and refreshingly bright red-currant fruitiness. This is ready now."
Testarossa 2013 Garys' Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),Testarossa,Red,Garys' Vineyard,,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$60,93,Matt Kettmann,"This lithe and lively Syrah offers Indian spices of black cardamom and chai on the nose alongside boysenberry, elderberry and graphite aromas. The palate is heavy with Christmas spice of pine, juniper and black clove, with camphor and eucalyptus elements playing against the raspberry fruit backdrop."
Barlow 2001 Red Table Wine Red (Napa Valley),Barlow,Red,Red Table Wine,"Cabernet Blend, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$30,90,,"One for the cellar. It opens with a swift kick of dusty tannins that numb the palate to the sweet blackcurrant and cherry fruit buried far below. On the finish, tannins and oak dominate. But such is the overall balance, and the core of fruit, that putting it away for 10 years is no gamble at all. Cabernet Sauvignon (80%) and Merlot."
Domaine Loubejac 2017 Rosé (Willamette Valley),Domaine Loubejac,Rose,,Rosé,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.1%,$17,87,Paul Gregutt,"Unlike most Oregon rosés, this is a blended wine, mixing five white grapes (principally Pinot Gris and Chardonnay) with a small addition (3%) of Pinot Noir, which provides a hint of color. Think dry pink wine, with mixed apple and pear fruit, and a dash of lemon and white pepper."
Crosby Roamann 2016 Crosby's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Crosby Roamann,Red,Crosby's Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15%,$90,93,Virginie Boone,"Blended with 16% Merlot, this has expansive structure and concentration, with a pleasing opening note of mint. Sage, cedar and dried herb follow, accenting a thick midpalate of dark cherry and dark chocolate. This can stand more time in the bottle; enjoy 2026–2030."
Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2014 Brauneberger Juffer-Sonnenuhr Spätlese Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel),Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,White,Brauneberger Juffer-Sonnenuhr Spätlese Grosse Lage,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",7.5%,$34,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A spray of rose petals perfumes this aromatic spätlese. Its freshness is exhilarating, contrasting lavish layers of honey and marmalade against the sharp bites of pineapple, tangerine and lemon. Cutting and spry, yet deeply penetrating, it finishes on a lingering pollen note."
Muhr-Van der Niepoort 2013 Liebkind Blaufränkisch (Carnuntum),Muhr-Van der Niepoort,Red,Liebkind,"Blaufränkisch, Other Red","Carnuntum, Austria",13.5%,$35,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A whole world of ideas assails the nose: coniferous forests, stone, ash and white pepper all tinge fresh blueberry and red cherry notes. On the palate, this is taut and tightly coiled. Fresh berries and cherries are still packed away beneath a layer of tart freshness, blinking through alluringly beneath the peppery spice. This is intriguing now but will open up like a flower with some bottle age. Its firm structure and innate freshness signal real ageing potential. Drink 2016–2026."
Stevens 2010 StevensFranc Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley),Stevens,Red,StevensFranc,Cabernet Franc,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.4%,$30,90,Paul Gregutt,"Tasted pre-release, this is clearly ready for prime time. It's both compact and generous, with a core of wild berries soaked in minerals. The words lucid and crystalline come to mind—rarely applied to a red wine, let alone Cab Franc."
James Mitchell 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),James Mitchell,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",13.9%,$15,87,Virginie Boone,"A great value Cabernet that's earthy and direct, this has just enough flavors of red and black cherry and tobacco, with soft tannins that keep the wine interesting through the long, slightly spicy finish. There are handfuls of estate-grown Petit Verdot, Petite Sirah, Merlot and Malbec in the mix. Pair it with hamburgers."
Simonnet-Febvre 2015 Côte de Lechet Premier Cru  (Chablis),Simonnet-Febvre,White,Côte de Lechet Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Chablis, Burgundy, France",13%,$35,92,Roger Voss,"This normally cool Premier Cru has done particularly well in the 2015 vintage. This bottling is ripe and full of white fruit, while keeping a strong line of fine, tight acidity. It will be ready to drink soon, so only wait until 2018."
Sojourn 2016 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Sojourn,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$39,90,Virginie Boone,"An appellation wine that impresses with its complexity, this offers earthy tones of bark, cinnamon and wild strawberry within a sultry sleek texture that's spicy and moderately structured."
Benvenuto de la Serna 2014 Malbec (Uco Valley),Benvenuto de la Serna,Red,,Malbec,"Uco Valley, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.2%,$20,89,Michael Schachner,"Challenging aromas of roasted beet, horseradish, herbal blackberry and animal hide lead to a meaty dense palate with rock-hard tannins. Flavors of black plum, blackberry and toasty oak are fiery, intense and carry over to a hot finish."
Lynmar 2005 Vin Gris of Pinot Noir Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Lynmar,Rose,Vin Gris of Pinot Noir,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$24,90,,"Pretty expensive for a rosé, but it's a seriously good, crisp wine from a premier Pinot producer. It features elegant strawberry, rose petal, tea and dried herb flavors that change with every sip. A dash of Syrah seems to add body and richness."
Château Brane-Cantenac 2017  Margaux,Château Brane-Cantenac,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$70,94,Roger Voss,"This ripe, spicy wine is full of blackberry fruits, generous tannins and touches of wood. Its balance is coming together, promising a complex wine that will also have weight and some concentration. Drink from 2024."
Imagine Moore 2009 Bliss Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes),Imagine Moore,White,Bliss,Sauvignon Blanc,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12%,$18,84,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Grassy and green with tart gooseberries and hints of honeysuckle and pineapple on the nose and palate, this dry wine a little lacking in concentration but refreshing with zippy acidity."
Ranfurlys Way 2001 Shiraz (Clare Valley),Ranfurlys Way,Red,,,"Clare Valley, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$29,88,,"This wine follows the “give the people what they want” formula to a T, and does it very well. It smells like blackberry jam and is moderate in size, with a core of plums and berries. Nut and toast nuances on the finish are the bow on the package. Imported by Aussie Imports."
Maddalena 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Maddalena,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$24,90,Matt Kettmann,"This widely available wine offers a reliably rich and expressive Cabernet experience. Aromas of blistered red cherry, wet slate, cocoa, pepper and oregano lead into a palate where coffee and black plum dominate."
Benjamin de Rothschild & Vega Sicilia SA 2009 Macán Clásico  (Rioja),Benjamin de Rothschild & Vega Sicilia SA,Red,Macán Clásico,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$50,92,Michael Schachner,"Lightly baked and charred on the nose, this is a well-oaked wine showing blackberry, cassis and lemon peel aromas. A saturated, layered palate features loamy blackberry and cassis flavors offset by peppery spice and cocoa dust. Licorice and blackened oak revive a sense of char on a broad, full finish. Drink through 2022."
Porto Carras 2008 Malagouzia (Halkidiki),Porto Carras,White,,"Malagouzia, Greek White","Halkidiki, Greece",13.5%,$22,89,Susan Kostrzewa,"This exotic white starts with aromas of white flowers, lemon and mint, followed by fuller-bodied flavors of peach, apricot and flowers. Balanced with a viscous mouthfeel. The wine is well-suited for robust dishes—think lobster—but also adds depth to simple grilled fish."
Château Couhins 2015 Barrel Sample  (Pessac-Léognan),Château Couhins,White,Barrel Sample,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,,91,Roger Voss,"90–92. Barrel Sample. This wine is crisp, herbal and full of green and citrus fruits. It is tangy and juicy at the end."
Château Talbot 2011  Saint-Julien,Château Talbot,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Julien, Bordeaux, France",,,91,Roger Voss,"With attractive, juicy fruit, this wine has as much freshness as it does structure. The palate is warm and open with blackberry fruits that are rounded and soft. Spice and some tannins show through on the finish. Drink from 2017."
Gravel Bar 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Gravel Bar,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$20,86,Sean P. Sullivan,"Black raspberry, plum, herb, tart, mesquite and cherry aromas are followed by lightly smoky flavors that seem out of place. It doesn't all come together."
Mesa 2019 Giunco  (Vermentino di Sardegna),Mesa,White,Giunco,"Vermentino, Italian White","Vermentino di Sardegna, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13.5%,$21,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Smooth, rounded and delicious, this dry, tangy white opens with enticing scents of Mediterranean scrub, white stone fruit and a whiff of Spanish broom. On the bright, medium-bodied palate, fresh acidity accompanies ripe pear, apricot and saline before finishing on a note of bitter almond."
Toscolo 2000  Chianti Classico,Toscolo,Red,,Sangiovese,"Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",12.5%,$19,85,Michael Schachner,"Saucy and spicy to the nose, with hints of chocolate, mocha and damp earth. Plum flavors and a smooth, moderately long finish keep this wine's head above water. Nonetheless, it's not real strong in the middle."
Adegas Gran Vinum 2007 Esencia Diviña Albariño (Rías Baixas),Adegas Gran Vinum,White,Esencia Diviña,Albariño,"Rías Baixas, Galicia, Spain",12.5%,$22,89,Michael Schachner,"With each vintage this estate improves, but at the top of the Albariño price tier it should be at least this good. There are lemon, almond and creamy aromas preceding apple, pear and melon flavors. The finish is clean, a little dusty and shows a hint of cider. Intricate enough, with fine overall balance."
James Charles 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon (Virginia),James Charles,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Virginia, Virginia, US",12.1%,$30,85,Carrie Dykes,"This wine offers jammy blueberry and lavender aromas that are tinged with brett. The palate brings high-octane flavors, supported by racy acidity that both demand more tannic structure and complexity in mouthfeel."
àMaurice 2010 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),àMaurice,White,,Viognier,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14%,$25,93,Paul Gregutt,"Superconcentrated, unctuous and lush, this mixes a note of lemon drop with a hint of ripe tropical fruit. On the palate, this shows terrific concentration, bearing hints of honey and lemon curd, with a crisp, lingering finish."
Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2016 RK Riesling (Mosel),Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt,White,RK,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",10.5%,$15,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Invigorating lemon and sage aromas contrast plump pink grapefruit and guava on the palate of this delicately sweet Riesling. It's a rounded yet elegant wine, with soft, sunny acidity and a crystalline mineral finish. Drink now through 2019."
Les Jamelles NV Méthode Traditionnelle Brut Chardonnay-Pinot Noir Sparkling Wine  (France),Les Jamelles,Sparkling,Méthode Traditionnelle Brut Chardonnay-Pinot Noir Sparkling Wine,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","France, France Other, France",12%,$21,87,Lauren Buzzeo,"Clean and fresh with lively citrus rind and red apple flesh aromas and flavors. It's not overdone and quite drinkable, with a soft toastiness that lingers through the finish. The texture is creamy and the swallow crisp."
Oregon Territory 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon),Oregon Territory,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",13.5%,$18,90,Paul Gregutt,"A separate label produced by Paul O'Brien winery, this is a stunning value in an Oregon Pinot Noir. In total, 20% of the fruit was sourced from the Willamette Valley, and all was barrel aged for a year in 15% new French oak. The pleasing toasty scents speak of a far pricier wine, and follow up with graceful, immaculate strawberry fruit. It's balanced out against proportionate acids and tannins, and is truly delicious for near term enjoyment."
Tower 15 2018 Star Lane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),Tower 15,Red,Star Lane Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California, US",15.2%,$90,90,Matt Kettmann,"Dark cocoa and elegant wood spice frame the smashed and grilled black-plum aromas on the nose of this bottling. Cedar flavors envelop the sip, where rounded berry and light herb flavors also arise."
Nicodemi 2017 Notàri  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane),Nicodemi,Red,Notàri,"Montepulciano, Italian Red","Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane, Central Italy, Italy",13.5%,$23,90,Alexander Peartree,"There's enviable concentration on the nose of this wine, delivering plumes of dark cherry, plum, salt and tobacco. There's power and verve to the thick-skinned berry fruit on the medium-bodied palate, built up by a sturdy frame of tannins and pushed along by a refreshing vein of acidity."
Dutton-Goldfield 2014 Devil's Gulch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Marin County),Dutton-Goldfield,Red,Devil's Gulch Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Marin County, North Coast, California, US",13.5%,$68,94,Jim Gordon,"Dense and concentrated, this wine is ultra smooth in texture, offering an abundance of red and black cherry, dark plum and baking spice aromas. One of the few Pinots grown in Marin County, it has great depth and a memorable flavor profile that lingers long into the finish."
Villa Giulia 2001 Alaura  (Chianti),Villa Giulia,Red,Alaura,Sangiovese,"Chianti, Tuscany, Italy",12.5%,$10,85,Michael Schachner,"Light in color and aromas. The nose is mostly dried red fruit and spice. The palate is tart yet precise; it's not sour but it's very peppy, with bright acids and plenty of red fruit in the raspberry or pie-cherry vein. A light, airy finish with a modicum of creaminess closes the package."
Château Durfort-Vivens 2016 Barrel Sample  (Margaux),Château Durfort-Vivens,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",,,96,Roger Voss,"95–97. Barrel Sample. Now certified biodynamic, this estate is on a roll. This vintage is very fine, rich and well structured. The dry core is contrasted by black fruit flavors. It is going to be generous and concentrated; there is long-term aging potential here."
Toad Hollow 2008 Goldie's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Toad Hollow,Red,Goldie's Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$15,82,,"The price is right, but the underlying wine is thin in fruit, offering only modest raspberry flavors. Oak has been plastered on rather heavily, perhaps to mask the basic blandness."
Provenance Vineyards 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Provenance Vineyards,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",,$40,89,,"Very dark and young now—this wine needs to be cellared. It's powerfully tannic, with a burst of acidity; the mouthfeel is dusty and astringent. Has enough fruit to last beyond 2008."
Marc Kreydenweiss 2004 La Dame Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Marc Kreydenweiss,White,La Dame Wiebelsberg Grand Cru,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",,$38,89,,"This is a serious selection for those who love a little more weight. Chock full of honey, sweet spice and butterscotch, you know what you're getting into from the first whiff. The palate only further complements the nose with the flavor of ripe, red apples elevating the sweeter aromas. Full- bodied and rich with a long, spicy finish."
Domaine des Remizières 2017 Cuvée Christophe  (Crozes-Hermitage),Domaine des Remizières,Red,Cuvée Christophe,,"Crozes-Hermitage, Rhône Valley, France",13.5%,$30,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Rich, open-knit plum and preserved-cherry flavors are shaded by hints of earth, ore and violet in this ripe, creamy Syrah. Aged 15 months in barriques (70% new and 30% one-year-old oak), it's a decadent, oakier expression of Crozes-Hermitage than most but elegantly composed. Best now–2025."
Chamisal 2016 Chamise Chardonnay (Edna Valley),Chamisal,White,Chamise,Chardonnay,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.8%,$75,91,Matt Kettmann,"Bright and fresh aromas of white peach, lightly tropical mango and a kiss of oak make for a compelling entry to this bottling. There is fresh zest to the palate, which offers ripe flavors of pear and apple flesh on a lighter frame."
Trentham 2000 Big Rivers Shiraz (Australia),Trentham,Red,Big Rivers,,"Australia, Australia Other, Australia",11%,$11,88,,"Dry, woodsy tannins rein in juicy red and black plum fruit on the palate; a wine with both solid fruit and a sense of restraint as this has is a good bet for a meal (and if I were cooking, that meal would be enchiladas). A very good wine that, had it more to the finish, could have been an excellent one. At this price, though, it's a minor complaint."
Taz 2004 Pinot Gris (Santa Barbara County),Taz,White,,,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",,$15,86,,"Super-fruity in peaches, citrus and apricots, with a creamy mouthfeel and brisk acidity, this is a fun wine with some real complexity. It's technically dry, but rich in fruity ripeness."
Marc Kreydenweiss 2004 Clos du Val d'Eléon White (Alsace),Marc Kreydenweiss,White,Clos du Val d'Eléon,"Alsace white blend, White Blend","Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$31,85,Joe Czerwinski,"A 50-50 blend of Pinot Gris and Riesling, this is a large-scale wine with aromas and flavors of nuts, anise and baked apples—maybe even a hint of butterscotch. Yet for all that sweet-sounding stuff, there's nothing soft about the hard, stony finish. A tough wine to really come to grips with."
Edgewood 2000 Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Edgewood,Red,Estate Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$35,90,,"This wine has a good, dark color, rich aromas of currants and toasty oak, blackberry flavors and fine, dry tannins. It merits a high score because of all these qualities, and yet it would score higher except for a certain absence of depth of flavor. Defines the deficiencies of this vintage."
Maximin Grünhäuser 2003 Herrenberg Riesling Spätlese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),Maximin Grünhäuser,White,Herrenberg Riesling Spätlese,Riesling,"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, Germany",7.5%,$28,92,Joe Czerwinski,"Wonderfully blends apple, pear and peach flavors, picking up mixed citrus fruits on the finish. Yet there's also a deep undercurrent of earth and mineral that provides a strong backbone. It's plump and concentrated on the palate, yet light on its feet. Great spätlese."
Adobe Road 2006 Bavarian Lion Vineyard Petite Sirah (Knights Valley),Adobe Road,Red,Bavarian Lion Vineyard,Petite Sirah,"Knights Valley, Sonoma, California, US",15.5%,$40,82,,"Too ripe, with a raisiny edge to the currants and blackberries. Hot, too, with 15.5% of alcohol. It's the poster child for what can go wrong with red wines in California."
Peirano 2008 Heritage Collection Tempranillo (Lodi),Peirano,Red,Heritage Collection,Tempranillo,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",14.2%,$12,83,Virginie Boone,"A wine with overly pronounced smoky, oaky and toasted bacon aromas and flavors that block out most of the lush dark fruit so wanting in a Tempranillo; more tobacco than black cherry or plum."
Corison 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),Corison,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"St. Helena, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$100,95,Virginie Boone,"From benchland vineyards, the winemaker's perennial beauty of a wine is structured, evolved, graceful and complex, with powerful floral aromatics of rose and violet. Earthy and herbal, it tastes of rock and iron, with bright underlying invitations of cassis, tangy cherry and plum. This will do well in the cellar; enjoy best from 2027 through 2030."
Martinshof 2016 Lobster Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),Martinshof,White,Lobster,Grüner Veltliner,"Niederösterreich, Austria",11%,$15,87,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The nose gives little away apart from a hint of green-pear peel. The palate is equally subdued, giving clean but almost neutral and slightly dilute notes of green pear. This is very fresh but provides little apart from some lemon and gentle pear fruit. Drink soon."
Ombu 2012 Pinot Noir (Mendoza),Ombu,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.4%,$13,84,Michael Schachner,"Leafy raspberry aromas are offset by cured-meat notes of sausage or ballpark hot dogs. This has a creamy yet flabby mouthfeel with barely detectable acidity. Baked cherry and raspberry flavors show touches of cinnamon and chocolate, while the finish is dull."
Ancient Peaks 2012 Margarita Vineyard Petit Verdot (Paso Robles),Ancient Peaks,Red,Margarita Vineyard,Petit Verdot,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$36,91,Matt Kettmann,"Aromas of pure black fruit, slightly burned toast, concentrated plum, black cherries and a touch of espresso show on this study of a rarely standalone grape. The palate is firm with chewy tannins yet approachable in flavors, offering dried elderberries, coffee beans, burned caramel flavors."
Sartori 2005 Regolo Corvina (Rosso del Veronese),Sartori,Red,Regolo,"Corvina, Italian Red","Rosso del Veronese, Veneto, Italy",13.5%,$21,87,,"Regolo is a pure expression of Corvina, a grape native to northern Italy, that opens with bright aromas of white cherry and cranberry, followed by a crisp mouthfeel and medium build. There's a subtle touch of sour berry on the close."
Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur 2012 La Tour du Gouverneur  (Bordeaux),Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur,Red,La Tour du Gouverneur,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",13%,,86,Roger Voss,"The 15th-century tower of the governor of Monségur gives its name to this wine from the local cooperative. It's a solid wine that has firm tannins along with jammy plum fruits and a ripe character. Blackberries dominate allowing some room, maybe not enough, for the acidity at the end. Drink now."
Lindemans 2005 Bin 80 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (South Eastern Australia),Lindemans,Red,Bin 80,"Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",13.5%,$8,83,Joe Czerwinski,"Simple and grapy, with touches of confected fruit and just a hint of chocolate on the slightly angular finish."
Concannon 2007 Reserve Chardonnay (Livermore Valley),Concannon,White,Reserve,Chardonnay,"Livermore Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$20,88,,"Oak and lees give rich, yeasty, butterscotchy complexities, and a creamy texture, to this fine young Chardonnay. Fortunately, the underlying varietal flavors are strong in pineapple, apple, honeydew and papaya. Only 500 cases were produced."
Branchini 2006 D'Or Luce Sillaro  (Albana di Romagna),Branchini,Dessert,D'Or Luce Sillaro,"Albana, Italian White","Albana di Romagna, Central Italy, Italy",11%,$45,92,,"Honey, roasted chestnut, dried apricot, lychee syrup and passion fruit shape a beautiful sweet botrytis wine that would pair with desserts or aged cheeses. It is seamless and elegant in the mouth and offers accents of orange zest and marzipan."
Caves Velhas 2013 Cabeça de Toiro Reserva Red (Tejo),Caves Velhas,Red,Cabeça de Toiro Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Tejo, Portugal",13.5%,$14,90,Roger Voss,"A blend of 50/50 Touriga Nacional an Castelão, this is a firm, structured wine. It has plenty of ripe blackberry fruits that are beginning to fill out and mature. It has a juicy character: ripe and full of sun. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2017."

Modest tannins work to spread the wine out, and the fruit, while thin and fading, seems ripe and not green."

Wine o'Clock 2009 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),Wine o'Clock,Red,,Sangiovese,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.6%,$22,88,Paul Gregutt,"Here is a tart and tangy take on Sangiovese, true to its Italian roots, but incorporating the sharp, vivacious fruit of Washington state. Red apple and plum, lightly dusted with chocolate and showing a trace of earthy barnyard, makes this one of the more interesting and complex versions of this grape to come out of the Columbia Valley."
Vinkara 2014 Reserve Narince (Ankara),Vinkara,White,Reserve,"Narince, Other White",,13.5%,$25,87,Mike DeSimone,"Aromas of apricot and rose petal prepare the palate for flavors of peach and grapefruit, with a hint of sage.

Cocobon 2013 Red (California),Cocobon,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","California, California Other, California, US",13%,$9,84,Jim Gordon,"A very deep red color catches the attention. Next, strong, wild aromas like smoke and black rubber lead to a rather fruity but still firm and tannic texture. The flavors are more like blackberries and blueberries, but the overall effect is slightly viscous."
Laurent Gauthier 2018 Vintage Rosé (Beaujolais),Laurent Gauthier,Rose,Vintage,Rosé,"Beaujolais, Beaujolais, France",13%,$17,88,Roger Voss,"This is a soft wine, with warm red-berry fruits and light acidity.

Iijima,"Intensely dusty, smoky mineral tones introduce this just-off-dry Riesling. It's a bracing, invigorating sip, offering layers of fresh lemon and lime flavors accented by salt and just a glimmer of tannins on the finish. A complex, thirst-quenching wine to enjoy now–2025."
SignoSeis 2014 The Angel Oak Rosé (Uco Valley),SignoSeis,Rose,The Angel Oak,Rosé,"Uco Valley, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.6%,$25,83,Michael Schachner,"This is tan in color, with a flat, murky nose of stone-fruit aromas and chemical harshness. A round, oily textured palate tastes of briny nectarine and pithy bitterness. In many ways, this is like sucking on a peach pit."
Hyatt 1997 Syrah (Yakima Valley),Hyatt,Red,,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13%,$20,87,,"It's a big, thick wine with hefty tannins and acidity; very dry and rather austere. It's not likely to improve in the bottle like a big Cabernet, but with the right foods--braised ribs--it could be just the right thing."
The Eyrie Vineyards 2013 Daphne Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),The Eyrie Vineyards,Red,Daphne Estate,Pinot Noir,"Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13%,$80,93,Paul Gregutt,"This selection from a 40-year-old vineyard manages to convey both power and complexity in a transparent, nearly ephemeral style. Like gazing into a clear pool of deep water, you plunge through a surface patina of ripe, crushed raspberries into a textural, evanescent palate framed in dark chocolate. Drink now through 2030 and beyond."
Carhartt Vineyard 2012 Fourplay Red (Santa Ynez Valley),Carhartt Vineyard,Red,Fourplay,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.4%,$43,89,Matt Kettmann,"Warm berry-rhubarb pie notes mix with black pepper and an appealing, shy layer of green bell pepper on this blend of 50% Merlot, 28% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot from three vineyards. Stewed plums, cherries and strawberries dominate the tasty palate, with a proper acidity and woody bitterness as balance."

Fetzer 2005 Valley Oaks Gewürztraminer (California),Fetzer,White,Valley Oaks,Gewürztraminer,"California, California Other, California, US",12%,$9,85,,"Shows real Gewürz character in the ripe peach, apricot, pineapple and vanilla flavors and blast of cinnamon-nutmeg spice. High acidity balances the sweetness, making the wine pleasantly clean and refreshing. Very nice as a pre-dinner drink, or with Asian food."
Château La Nerthe 2014 Les Granières de la Nerthe Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),Château La Nerthe,Red,Les Granières de la Nerthe,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rhône Valley, France",14%,VivinoWine Express,91,Joe Czerwinski,"For what is essentially a second wine, generally blended from the estate's younger vines, this is a solid effort in a not-so-easy vintage. Vanilla and cinnamon from barrel-aging play a role hedre, but there's also plenty of juicy, plum-tinged fruit. There's ample body and texture, capped off by supple tannins and a lingering finish. Drink now–2022."
Archery Summit 2012 Archer's Edge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Archery Summit,Red,Archer's Edge Estate,Pinot Noir,"Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.5%,VivinoWine.com,90,Paul Gregutt,"The vineyard is one of the youngest at the winery, and the flavors reflect that, with bright, fruity, forward raspberry notes. It's lightly spiked with sweet baking spices, and makes a perfectly delicious choice while waiting for some of the winery's bigger, bolder 2012s to age a bit further."
Ferraud et Fils 2013 La Chardonneraie  (Saint-Véran),Ferraud et Fils,White,La Chardonneraie,Chardonnay,"Saint-Véran, Burgundy, France",13%,,84,Roger Voss,"This wine is soft, indistinct at this stage.

Sullenger Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",14.1%,$100,92,,"A glorious wine, rich, ripe and delicious. It's dry, but lush in blackberries and cherries, tobacco and cola, with the Nickel &amp; Nickel signature of new and one-year-old oak. Very tannic, this is clearly a wine that needs time. Should begin to come into its own after 2018."
R.H. Phillips 2003 Sauvignon Blanc (Dunnigan Hills),R.H. Phillips,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Dunnigan Hills, Central Valley, California, US",,$8,84,,"An easy-sipping white wine, with semisweet fruit flavors and soft acids. Finishes clean and honeyed."

The mouthfeel is lush, broad and quietly powerful, while subtle pear and marzipan flavors coat the palate and linger on the finish. It makes a grand impression and is “meaty” enough to serve with poultry or even beef. Winemaker Tracy Hart used no oak or stainless steel, fermenting and aging the wine in food-grade polyethylene FlexTanks."
Lambardi 2013  Brunello di Montalcino,Lambardi,Red,,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$80,95,Kerin O’Keefe,"Wild berry, fragrant purple flower, new leather and cake-spice aromas come together to create a classic Sangiovese bouquet. On the firm full-bodied palate, white pepper, clove and tobacco accent a juicy black-cherry and raspberry core. Tightly knit polished tannins and fresh acidity provide an age-worthy structure. Drink 2021–2038."
San Pedro 2007 Kankana del Elqui Syrah (Elqui Valley),San Pedro,Red,Kankana del Elqui,,"Elqui Valley, Chile",14%,$44,91,Michael Schachner,"Sweet and a bit choppy on the nose, with aromas of wood shavings, mocha, fine herbs and spicy black fruits. Flush, lusty and big across the palate, but juicy and clean, with subtle bush berry and spice flavors. Finishes clean and subtle, with floral accents and a touch of heat. Drink now through 2013."

Dry mineral notes and crisp acidity balance out those ripe fruit flavors."
Brezza 2010 Sarmassa  (Barolo),Brezza,Red,Sarmassa,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$67,97,Kerin O’Keefe,"From one of the best sites in Barolo, this intense wine opens with a multi-dimensional fragrance of crushed flower, new leather, earth, incense, spice and black cherry. The vibrant, spicy palate delivers red berry accented with notes of black pepper, cinnamon spice, licorice and clove. Bold but noble tannins and brisk acidity promise fantastic aging potential. Drink 2020–2050. Acid Inc Selections, Stefano Miretti Imports."
Ken Forrester 2010 Reserve Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),Ken Forrester,White,Reserve,Chenin Blanc,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",14.5%,$15,90,Lauren Buzzeo,"A strong toasty streak lines the essence of this beautiful Chenin Blanc, adding character to the apple and pear fruit core. The mouthfeel is full and rich without being overdone thanks to the balanced acidity, while nuances of sweet spice, pie crust and wood-grilled Red Delicious all linger well into the long finish."
Eden Road 2015 The Long Road Chardonnay (Tumbarumba),Eden Road,White,The Long Road,Chardonnay,"Tumbarumba, New South Wales, Australia",12.5%,$25,88,Christina Pickard,"Despite there being a few months less of oak aging on this vintage than the 2016, the oak is more apparent in this wine. This style of Chardy isn't for everyone, but those who do like oaked Chards will appreciate the buttery, toasted nut, pressed yellow-flower and stalk characters on this linear lemony wine."
Rioja Vega 2007 Crianza  (Rioja),Rioja Vega,Red,Crianza,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$12,83,Michael Schachner,"Smells fairly burnt and dull, with earthy, stemmy aromas that are strained and tough. The palate reflects the nose with heavy, roasted, leathery plum flavors that finish with a meaty thud. Rustic and stemmy, with a low pulse."
Trisaetum 2013 Ribbon Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),Trisaetum,Red,Ribbon Ridge Estate,Pinot Noir,"Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.3%,$49,94,Paul Gregutt,"This is the vineyard that surrounds the winery on Ribbon Ridge, and it seems always to produce the wines with the greatest concentration and density. The black cherry fruit, with aromatic accents of rose petals and highlights of oregano, digs deep into the midpalate, creating an impression of a bulky, tight, compact wine with miles yet to go. Cellar it for drinking from 2020 through 2030."
Peter Nicolay 2005 Ürziger Würzgarten Spätlese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),Peter Nicolay,White,Ürziger Würzgarten Spätlese,Riesling,"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, Germany",9.5%,$23,89,Joe Czerwinski,

Metz,White,Melody,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$20,90,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Fresh notes of ripe red apple and juicy pear rise from the glass and also swish freely across the palate.

Pear flavors the midpalate, then turns citrusy on the finish."
Saviah 2018 Une Vallée Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Saviah,Red,Une Vallée,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.6%,$40,91,Sean P.

Brightly layered and deeply flavored, it's a full-bodied rendition that remains true to its variety."
Colosi 1999 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),Colosi,Red,,"Nero d'Avola, Italian Red","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",12%,$12,87,Joe Czerwinski,"Six months of aging in Slavonian oak has imparted a delicate cedary sheen to the juicy black-cherry flavors.  Balancing acidity prevents it from being just another fruit bomb, and it develops some intriguing leather notes with air.  Made of 90% Nero d'Avola, with 10% other mixed indigenous varieties, and from a small (five hectare) estate, this is just one example of why Sicily is a hotbed for bargain hunters.  Modern technology and careful viticulture combined with hot sunny weather and unique grapes are yielding great wines at great prices."
Bernhard Ott 2012 Stein Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland),Bernhard Ott,White,Stein,Grüner Veltliner,"Wagram-Donauland, Austria",13.5%,,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Perfumed notions of green pear lie within a supple, rounded body. The zesty acidity is welcome but not dominating and the core of fruit is firm and inviting."
Jeff Cohn 2016 Zio Tony Ranch Syrah (Russian River Valley),Jeff Cohn,Red,Zio Tony Ranch,,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",15.6%,$85,95,Virginie Boone,"From a relatively cool-climate site, this wine is dark and inky with fistfuls of earthy forest floor, grilled meat and wild game.

Peters Family 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),Peters Family,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sonoma Mountain, Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$55,86,,"This is tartly sweet and jammy, like a cherry and roasted almond candy bar with a chocolate coating. Tasty, but a little one dimensional."
Land of Promise 2016 E Pluribus Unum Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Land of Promise,Red,E Pluribus Unum,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",13.6%,$75,93,Virginie Boone,"Light, high-toned and persistently fresh, this is an exotic red wine from Terra de Promissio, shiny and bright in rhubarb, wild strawberry and orange peel.

Campogiovanni 2000  Brunello di Montalcino,Campogiovanni,Red,,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",,$65,88,Michael Schachner,"Fully charred, with a lot of leather and campfire to the nose.

Sandrone 1998  Dolcetto d'Alba,Sandrone,Red,,"Dolcetto, Italian Red","Dolcetto d'Alba, Piedmont, Italy",12.5%,$25,93,,"A beautiful Dolcetto, defining the state-of-the-art for this grape. Black cherry, violets, roses, and vanilla mark the lovely nose. Robust flavors of cherry, chocolate, and licorice mark the palate. The feel is plush and round, but still substantial, with an admirable seamlessness."
Peju 2012 Rosé of Syrah (Napa Valley),Peju,Rose,Rosé of,,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.5%,$25,86,,"This 100% Syrah has a watermelon-pink color, and it tastes like watermelon, too, with a squeeze of strawberry daiquiri. It finishes with a hint of sweetness."

Eden,White,Bien Nacido Vyd Signature,Chardonnay,"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$32,90,,"A real crowd-pleaser, this wine has big, bold aromas of citrus fruits, apples and peaches, with a streak of smoky oak and complications from sur lies aging.  It drinks very rich and fine.  Citrus flavors dominate, with a flinty element, and high acidity suggests midterm aging."
Campion 2000 Pinot Noir (Carneros),Campion,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",,$32,86,,"This pretty, stylish wine is elegantly silky in the mouth, with hardly any tannins at all, although the acids are fine. Flavors are on the jammy side, with raspberry, tea, cola and spice."

Sullivan,"Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah make up this wine. Lighter in color, the aromas suggest fresh raspberry, berry and currant. The palate shows an elegant styling, with citrus notes on the finish. There are good things going on but the concentration seems light."
Chateau St. Jean 1997 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),Chateau St. Jean,Red,Durell Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.6%,$30,90,,"A full nose of deep and spicy black-cherry, clove, smoke, bacon, and cinnamon aromas open this solidly built wine. Lots of dark fruit, red apples, spice, and even chocolate nuances. Large almost licorice-tinged finish. Very tasty now and should improve."

Quinta do Portal 2003 Touriga Nacional (Douro),Quinta do Portal,Red,,"Touriga Nacional, Portuguese Red","Douro, Portugal",15.5%,$20,88,Roger Voss,"A huge wine, full of soft fruit. The layers of tannins sit gently on the plum and cassis fruits, lifted by acidity. If it wasn't 15.5%, this would be impressive, but the high alcohol makes the wine very Port-like, giving an extra layer of pepper from the alcohol."
Château Haut Prieur 2013  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,Château Haut Prieur,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,,83,Roger Voss,"This wine is tough, extracted and still very bitter. The fruit is there, well behind the tannic front in this Merlot/Malbec blend. Give the wine until 2017 and decant although it is likely to remain tough. A Châteaux Solidaires wine."

The acidity is soft across the midpalate, but it brightens on the warm, medium-length finish. To appreciate the full spectrum of aromas and flavors, don't drink this too cold."

Iijima,"Orange-blossom, tangerine and white-melon notes extend from nose to palate in this effusively fresh dry Riesling. It's medium bodied and silky in texture, bursting with zesty citrus flavors and subtle skeins of honey and candle wax. Enjoyable now for its exuberant  style, it should develop greater complexities through 2030."

Sullivan,"Examples of this variety are a rarity in the state, with this one made in a Beaujolais Nouveau style—100% whole cluster and all carbonic maceration before aging in neutral oak. The aromas intrigue, with notes of cigar box, tobacco, herb, strawberry and flower, showing clear stem influence. Light, vibrant and pure red-fruit flavors follow. It shows a sense of focus that enchants. Best with a slight chill."
Argiano 2012 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),Argiano,Red,Riserva,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$300,93,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of scorched earth, underbrush, new leather and grilled herb align with a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus.

Apaltagua 2014 Carmenere Rosé (Central Valley),Apaltagua,Rose,Carmenere,Rosé,"Central Valley, Chile",13%,$13,86,Michael Schachner,"Almost neutral aromas of cantaloupe and nectarine are dusty on the nose. This Carmenère-based dry rosé is citric, juicy and tight on the palate, with grapefruit and other citrus flavors adding life. Orange and citrus pith notes control the finish."
Penfolds 2002 Koonunga Hill Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),Penfolds,White,Koonunga Hill,Chardonnay,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",,VivinoGary's Wine,84,,"Good for casual circumstances, this is a simple oak-and-yellow fruit Chard, with stone fruit and smoke on the nose, and oaky, malty flavors on the finish."
Casa Cadaval 2012 Touriga Nacional (Tejo),Casa Cadaval,Red,,"Touriga Nacional, Portuguese Red","Tejo, Portugal",13.5%,$22,86,Roger Voss,"This is a wood-aged Touriga Nacional that is smooth and rich.

Patz & Hall 2006 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),Patz & Hall,White,Hyde Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",,$55,87,,"Although many will find this Chard fancy and worth the price, the oak sticks out too much, giving it outsized butterscotch and toast flavors. Maybe something less than 40% new oak would have let the tropical fruit, citrus and pear flavors express themselves more purely. Excessive oak has marred Patz & Hall Chardonnays in the past."
Joseph Mellot 2006 La Rimonet  (Quincy),Joseph Mellot,White,La Rimonet,Sauvignon Blanc,"Quincy, Loire Valley, France",12.5%,$18,83,Roger Voss,"Candy and fruit drops are the first impression of this young wine. It has some good fruit, more in the honeyed and nut character, but that heavily perfumed candy character doesn't fit well."

Stolpman 2008 Estate Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),Stolpman,Red,Estate,Grenache,"Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",15.6%,$34,85,,"Too hot, with 15.6% alcohol, and it shows in the chile pepper heat. Also too soft, lacking structure. With the glycerine, it tastes like a sweet Starbucks drink with raspberry, mocha, vanilla and cinnamon flavors."
Feudo Disisa 2015 Grillo (Sicilia),Feudo Disisa,White,,"Grillo, Italian White","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",,,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Citrus, Mediterranean herb and cut grass aromas lead the way.

Woodenhead 2011 Wet Kiss Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Woodenhead,Red,Wet Kiss,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.7%,$52,88,Virginie Boone,"A field of mint is found on the nose of this soft, spicy wine with the gimmicky name, around a core of red cherry and touch of oak. Fresh and bright, it has a suggestion of heft on the finish."
Hall 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Hall,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$24,91,Virginie Boone,"A dry, stainless-steel fermented wine, this presents a generous floral bouquet upon entry, followed by a creamy palate, with textural layers of apricot and peach. Medium bodied, it remains refreshing throughout, making it an ideal choice for lighter occasions and lighter fare."
Goulée 2008 Barrel sample  (Médoc),Goulée,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Médoc, Bordeaux, France",,,90,Roger Voss,"89-91 Barrel sample. Owned by Cos d'Estournel, this is made in a sumptuous style for a Médoc wine. It is plump, ripe, the fruit the sole event here. It is sweet black and rich. For early drinking."

Domaine St. Damien 2003 Vieilles Vignes  (Gigondas),Domaine St. Damien,Red,Vieilles Vignes,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Gigondas, Rhône Valley, France",,,82,Joe Czerwinski,"Features a creamy mouthfeel and supple tannins, but also entirely too much brett influence. Smells and tastes like a well-worn Band Aid."
Monte Faustino 2011  Recioto della Valpolicella Classico,Monte Faustino,Dessert,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Recioto della Valpolicella Classico, Veneto, Italy",14%,$45,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Delicately scented, this opens with aromas of dried black cherry and toasted notes. On the concentrated palate, oak-driven spice takes center stage while mature dark-skinned fruit and dried prune provide the background. Pair it with Gorgonzola at the end of the meal."

The latest Merlot is up a quality notch from most Down Under. A mélange of cherry, licorice and scrubby Mediterranean herbs and spices is coated in a cola-driven sheen of polished oak. Lighter than others under this label, this is nonetheless a big wine which captures the juicy red fruit via lifted acidity and well-structured, savory tannins. Drink now–2028."
Château la Calisse 2016 Patricia Ortelli Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence),Château la Calisse,Rose,Patricia Ortelli,Rosé,"Coteaux Varois en Provence, Provence, France",13.5%,$35,89,Roger Voss,"This small appellation is an enclave in the middle of Côtes de Provence. Its style is very similar and this wine, named after the owner, is a structured blend of Syrah and Grenache. The wine from organic grapes has a pepper and spice edge over the crisp acidity of the red fruits. Drink now."
Château Hermitage Saint-Martin 2014 Ikon Rosé (Côtes de Provence),Château Hermitage Saint-Martin,Rose,Ikon,Rosé,"Côtes de Provence, Provence, France",12.5%,$35,90,Roger Voss,"The heavy bottle signals this is statement rosé. It's certainly rich, full in the mouth with spice, acidity and tangerine flavors mingling well together. The wine is deliciously textured and could do with some more aging. Drink from the end of 2015."

In the mouth, it rings with acidity such that raspberry and red-plum flavors taste sour. Tasted twice with similar results."
Schmelz 2007 Pichl Point Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),Schmelz,White,Pichl Point Smaragd,Grüner Veltliner,"Wachau, Austria",13.5%,$38,94,Roger Voss,"Johann Schmelz has produced a voluptuous wine, full of ripe fruits and a velvet texture. Of course, the acidity is there, giving the wine a crisp edge, but it is the rich structure and flavors of apricots, red apples and spice that blend together in a harmonious, balanced whole. Imported by Blue Danube Wine Co."
Philippe Jeannot 2015  Bourgogne,Philippe Jeannot,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Bourgogne, Burgundy, France",13%,$18,86,Roger Voss,"This soft, rich wine is a delicious reminder of the great fruit in this vintage.

Falernia 2006 Reserva Syrah (Elqui Valley),Falernia,Red,Reserva,,"Elqui Valley, Chile",14%,$12,87,Michael Schachner,"Savory, minty, foresty and showing its own style and personality. Not a generic Syrah; there's leather, fir tree and berry aromas, and then a large, mouthfilling palate full of savory, herbal berry flavors accented by oak and BBQ notes. Hard to peg as varietal Syrah but definitely a good wine with character."
Château le Temple 2010  Médoc,Château le Temple,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Médoc, Bordeaux, France",14%,,90,Roger Voss,"Close to the Gironde estuary, le Temple's wines are dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, making for a powerful, complex bottling, with great acidity and black currant flavor. This has potential to age for at least five years."
Le Carré 2010 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),Le Carré,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,92,Roger Voss,"91-93 A powerful wine, very ripe and rounded. Finely concentrated, with dark plum skins and opulent tannins."
Darioush 2015 Caravan Red (Napa Valley),Darioush,Red,Caravan,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.8%,$52,90,Virginie Boone,"This is a bold, hearty Bordeaux blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Malbec and 5% Cabernet Franc. Substantial in tannin and oak, it has softened edges of earthiness, forest and sage. Nuanced black fruit complements the graphite and savory spice."
La Scolca 2002 Il Valentino  (Gavi di Gavi),La Scolca,White,Il Valentino,"Cortese, Italian White","Gavi di Gavi, Piedmont, Italy",11.5%,,84,Joe Czerwinski,"Standard tart and refreshing stuff, with added notes that hint at anise and sour cream. Light-bodied, drink as an apéritif."

Castle Rock 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Castle Rock,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$15,85,Paul Gregutt,"This value brand makes a number of West Coast Pinots, with mixed results. Here are very strong, dominating flavors of vanilla and breakfast tea, of the sort often associated with oak additions during the winemaking process. Don't look for any specific Willamette Valley character here. It's a light generic red, tasting mostly of vanilla."
Washington Hills 2002 Shiraz (Columbia Valley (WA)),Washington Hills,Red,,,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.5%,$9,85,,"Another well-priced offering out of Washington's Columbia Valley, this one offering pretty caramel and coffee scents and raspberry and herb flavors.

Calcu 2017 Reserva Especial Rosé (Colchagua Valley),Calcu,Rose,Reserva Especial,Rosé,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",12%,$13,83,Michael Schachner,One whiff tells you this rosé of Malbec and 10% Petit Verdot is all about pyrazines. A high level of citric acid drives a palate that tastes of orange extract and gritty bitterness. Beyond tang there's not much to a sharp finish.
Scott Paul 2015 Azana Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),Scott Paul,Red,Azana,Pinot Noir,"Chehalem Mountains, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13%,$60,92,Paul Gregutt,"Scott Paul's Azana is precise and distinctive, delivering a focused fusion of strawberry, blueberry and spicy cherry flavors. There's a pleasing touch of lightly earthy funk as well, and the overall balance keeps it interesting and on point through the finish."

The palate offers dried black cherry and ground pepper alongside fine-grained tannins. It also shows the heat of the vintage, so drink soon."
Podere Ruggeri Corsini 2005 Corsini  (Barolo),Podere Ruggeri Corsini,Red,Corsini,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$49,91,,"Youthful and bright now, this elegant wine will surely benefit from five to ten more years of cellar aging. At this point, the wine is very focused on oak-driven aromas of spice, cedar, chocolate, old leather and toasted nut but the quality of the fruit comes through. Drink with succulent red meats."
Cantine Ermes 2019 Quattro Quarti Grillo (Sicilia),Cantine Ermes,White,Quattro Quarti,"Grillo, Italian White","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",12.5%,$15,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"White spring-flower and white stone-fruit aromas form the delicate nose.

Testarossa 2005 Castello Chardonnay (Central Coast),Testarossa,White,Castello,Chardonnay,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$28,85,,"Puts all the pieces of the puzzle together, combining ripe tropical fruit, ample sweet oak and coastal acidity, but the picture is a little blurry. The wine is decadently ripe and obvious."
Domaine Laporte 2017 Le Bouquet Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),Domaine Laporte,White,Le Bouquet,Sauvignon Blanc,"Vin de France, France Other, France",12%,$20,87,Roger Voss,"A blend from grapes mainly across the Loire regions, this fruit, crisp and herbal wine is a pleasing homage to Sauvignon Blanc.

Domaine Serene 2014 Coeur Blanc Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Domaine Serene,White,Coeur Blanc,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.2%,$95,94,Paul Gregutt,"A barrel-fermented white Pinot Noir, this is bursting with broad, creamy flavors of ripe caramel-dipped apples and fresh pear. It might be mistaken for Chardonnay, except for the extra weight that carries through the lengthy finish. Though it's tempting to describe white Pinot Noirs as sparkling wines without the sparkle, this is much more interesting, and one of the rare examples that defines both a style and a standard for the rest."
Barone di Villagrande 2014 Passito  (Malvasia delle Lipari),Barone di Villagrande,Dessert,Passito,"Malvasia, Italian White","Malvasia delle Lipari, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13.5%,,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"This deeply hued, almost amber-colored dessert wine has aromas of toast, apricot and roasted nut.

Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$30,90,Matt Kettmann,"These old vines produce a compelling style of Sauvignon Blanc, which begins with honeyed aromas of baked apple and Meyer lemon, with an underlying grass touch. The palate offers hints of toasted nuts and more baked apple, with a pinch of sea salt as well."
Chamisal 2017 Chamise Chardonnay (Edna Valley),Chamisal,White,Chamise,Chardonnay,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.6%,$75,92,Matt Kettmann,"Dried lemon, hints of almond and a brush of sour cream make for a very clean and intriguing nose on this bottling. The palate combines toasted wood, baked lemon and yellow-cake aromas, with pinches of salt and brown spice adding even more warmth."
Carpineto 2001 Sillano Red (Toscana),Carpineto,Red,Sillano,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$70,92,,"Here's a super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon that shows its 10 years of age surprising well.

Nuiton-Beaunoy 2012  Pommard,Nuiton-Beaunoy,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Pommard, Burgundy, France",13%,,88,Roger Voss,"Some firm tannins lie at the back of this dry, solid wine. It has dark plum fruits, juicy acidity and a fresher aftertaste. It's balanced and needs a little aging. Drink from 2017."
Harmony Cellars 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Harmony Cellars,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",13.9%,$23,91,Matt Kettmann,"Numerous lively aromas kick off this bottling, from black currant and purple flower to savory smoke and black peppercorn. The palate is framed by buoyant acidity and chalky tannins, which hold up rich black cherry, clove, licorice and mocha flavors."
Monticello Vineyards 2000 Proprietary Red (Napa Valley),Monticello Vineyards,Red,Proprietary,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$50,91,,"An unusual blend dominated by Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with only ten percent Cabernet Sauvignon. Very dark, rich and fruity, with cassis, blackcurrant, anise and herb flavors that are wrapped in big, sturdy tannins. Too young to drink now, unless it's with an enormous dish like braised short ribs, but best left for four or five years."
Cortes de Cima 2008 Aragonez (Alentejano),Cortes de Cima,Red,,"Aragonez, Tempranillo","Alentejano, Portugal",14%,$45,89,Roger Voss,"A ripe, smoky wood- and black fruit-driven wine.

Sullivan,"Generous, appealing melon, pear and apple aromas are followed by plump but still elegant while well-balanced fruit flavors. It's a bit one note but it hits that note well."
Nickel & Nickel 2006 State Lane Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),Nickel & Nickel,Red,State Lane Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Yountville, Napa, California, US",14.6%,$90,92,,"Dark as midnight and very tannic and dry, this 100% Cabernet is somewhat forbidding in its turbulent youth. It's very astringent and chewy, and the palate has to work to bite through to the core of blackberries, black cherries and cassis. Has all the hallmarks of a wine that will benefit from extended aging. Give it at least until 2012 and try again."
Stift Göttweig 2017 Ried Gott Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),Stift Göttweig,White,Ried Gott Reserve,Grüner Veltliner,"Kremstal, Austria",13.5%,$51,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The merest whiff of gunflint on the nose gives way to subtle pear and lemon zest notes. The palate comes in with the animating juiciness of really ripe lemon and continues in this slender, juicy, refreshing and concentrated fashion. This is full of flow, ease and lemony joy and provides perfect refreshment."
Château de la Terrière 2006 Vieilles Vignes Cuvée Jules du Souzy  (Brouilly),Château de la Terrière,Red,Vieilles Vignes Cuvée Jules du Souzy,Gamay,"Brouilly, Beaujolais, France",13%,$22,90,Roger Voss,"Rich, concentrated red and black plum flavor dominate a wine that shows structure as well as intensity. This is powerful stuff, a delicious wine, fruity but with a core of dark tannins. It is just edging into maturity, so drink this year. The name recalls the Counts of Souzy who once governed the region."
Pasorina 2012 Moscato (California),Pasorina,White,,"Moscato, Muscat","California, California Other, California, US",8.5%,$10,84,,"Is this wine off-dry or dessert sweet? It straddles the border, with white sugar, peach, orange, vanilla and creamy flavors."
Gypsy Canyon 2004 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Gypsy Canyon,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",,$75,89,,"This is the second vintage from this tiny winery. This is a bone-dry Pinot, dark and full-bodied. It's not a fruit bomb, but shows a controlled balance of rhubarb pie, cola, cherry and coffee flavors, wrapped in rich, sturdy tannins and a velvety texture. A little rustic now, this fine wine should develop further by 2007 and hold for several years."
Alain Brumont 2009 Château Montus Blanc  (Pacherenc du Vic Bilh),Alain Brumont,White,Château Montus Blanc,White Blend,"Pacherenc du Vic Bilh, Southwest France, France",14.5%,,90,Roger Voss,"The white wine at Montus is a blend of many of the local grapes, including the rare Petit Courbu. It has a herbaceous character that's broadened with toast and lively acidity. Finely perfumed and rich, it has an apple- and quince-flavored finish."

Château de l'Aubrade 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),Château de l'Aubrade,Rose,,Rosé,"Bordeaux Rosé, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$12,89,Roger Voss,"Fresh and crisply fruity, this is a balanced, lively wine.

Nigl 2007 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),Nigl,Dessert,Eiswein,Grüner Veltliner,"Kremstal, Austria",,,92,Roger Voss,"Not so much sweet as intensely rich, peppery and zesty with orange peel and spiced pear juice flavors. It is concentrated, intense, likely to last for many years."

Its juicy acidity is full of potential, giving a ripe character with red berry fruits and a tannic structure to balance. The wine's fruit gives a fresher feel at the end."
Hawk Watch Winery 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (South Coast),Hawk Watch Winery,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"South Coast, South Coast, California, US",13.6%,$21,87,Matt Kettmann,"Clean aromas of ripe nectarine and Anjou pear skins meet with lime pith, cut grass and cement on the nose of this bottling from the San Diego area.

Mixed in are rich flavors of cherries, raspberries and cola, sprinkled with cinnamon and pepper. An exotic, powerful wine. Too bold and in your face now, but should gain traction over the next eight years."
Château de Myrat 2005 Barrel sample  (Barsac),Château de Myrat,Dessert,Barrel sample,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Barsac, Bordeaux, France",,,91,Roger Voss,"90-92 Barrel sample.

The palate is ripe and full bodied, offering raisin, dried black cherry and a hint of exotic spice. Close-grained tannins give it a grippy finish."
Andrew Januik 2017 Stone Cairn Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),Andrew Januik,Red,Stone Cairn,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.6%,$40,92,Sean P.

San Silvestro 2016 Primaio  (Dolcetto d'Alba),San Silvestro,Red,Primaio,"Dolcetto, Italian Red","Dolcetto d'Alba, Piedmont, Italy",12.5%,$16,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"This simple red leads with baking spice, underbrush and red-skinned berry aromas.

Hamilton Russell 2006 Pinot Noir (Walker Bay),Hamilton Russell,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Walker Bay, South Africa",14%,$36,89,Susan Kostrzewa,"Hamilton Russell continues to lead the pack in producing consistent, elegant wines.

Chateau Morrisette 2011 Chardonnay (Virginia),Chateau Morrisette,White,,Chardonnay,"Virginia, Virginia, US",13%,$18,84,,"Toasted popcorn kernel is the chief note. Medium in body, it bears simple pomaceous flavors and even-keeled acids."
Château Haut-Cadet 2015  Saint-Émilion,Château Haut-Cadet,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$25,89,Roger Voss,"From an estate situated close to the vineyards of Pomerol, the 82% Merlot in this blend gives a sumptuous wine that will be ripe and full when it matures.

William Fèvre 2005 Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis),William Fèvre,White,Montmains Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Chablis, Burgundy, France",,$40,90,Roger Voss,"There's a fine balance here between minerality and rich toast.

Dante Rivetti 2007 Bricco di Neive Riserva  (Barbaresco),Dante Rivetti,Red,Bricco di Neive Riserva,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",,$55,88,,"Indian spice, cardamom, clove and dried berry aromas open the nose. The palate has a raw, chewy quality, so give this 10 more years of cellar aging."
Proulx 2006 Yellow Label Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),Proulx,Red,Yellow Label,Petite Sirah,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15.4%,$24,81,,"A simple, awkward Petite Sirah, showing overripe flavors and a soft, melted texture. Tastes syrupy in cola and berries."

The smokiness and blackberry fruits are allied to layers of tight acidity. The wine is ready to drink.
Larchago 2014 Val de Oron  (Ribera del Duero),Larchago,Red,Val de Oron,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$17,85,Michael Schachner,"Wiry, withdrawn plum aromas are a touch floral.

De Bortoli 2016 Deen Vat Series No 5 Botrytis Semillon (Riverina),De Bortoli,Dessert,Deen Vat Series No 5 Botrytis,"Sémillon, Sémillon","Riverina, New South Wales, Australia",10.5%,$18,93,Christina Pickard,"From a vineyard planted in 2003 specifically for botrytis wines, this is a pure delight. It oozes notes of honeyed nuts, ripe lemons, blossoms and just a touch of mushroom. The palate is rich and viscous, but there's beautifully bright acidity to cut through the creaminess and make the mouth water for another sip. The finish lingers on honey and citrus."
Aurelio Settimo 2007  Barolo,Aurelio Settimo,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",,$55,93,,"You'll love the powerful richness and natural concentration of this beautiful Barolo. It boasts masculine renderings of cherry liqueur, carob pod, red rose and sassy cinnamon spice. The wine shows great aging potential (10 years or more) thanks to its firm tannins and fresh acidity."

It shows up as buttered toast, with a distinctive, charry-sweet note of toasted marshmallows. The wine is strong in pineapples and oranges. An eccentric Chardonnay for drinking now."
Spy Valley 2003 Chardonnay (Marlborough),Spy Valley,White,,Chardonnay,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13.5%,$25,86,Joe Czerwinski,"A plump, fleshy Chardonnay that delivers plenty of pear and peach aromas and flavors.

Bellante 2018 Bentrock Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Bellante,Red,Bentrock Vineyard Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.9%,$65,88,Matt Kettmann,"A bit dark in color and extracted in aroma, this bottling offers black cherry, boysenberry and peppery spices on the nose. It's big and brawny on the palate, mostly showing tangy boysenberry."
Barfontarc NV Brut Tradition  (Champagne),Barfontarc,Sparkling,Brut Tradition,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$54,88,Roger Voss,"There is a touch of toast to this full, soft wine.

Domaine Didier Lagneau 2017 Cuvée Jeannine  (Beaujolais-Villages),Domaine Didier Lagneau,Red,Cuvée Jeannine,Gamay,"Beaujolais-Villages, Beaujolais, France",12.5%,$15,90,Roger Voss,"From vines that are at least 70 years old, this wine shows great concentration and density.

On the firmly structured palate, integrated, close-grained tannins frame mature black cherry, licorice, clove and grilled herb. Give it time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2022–2035."
Rodney Strong 1999 Alden Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Rodney Strong,Red,Alden Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$30,91,,"From vineyards quite high up in the eastern mountains, this wine is from stressed, low-yielding grapes. The blackberry and cassis flavors are concentrated and dense, and the tannins are tough and firm. Oak plays a supporting role. Rich foods, such as lamb or gongonzola cheese, will soften and sweeten it, but you're best off cellaring for a few years."
Château Panchille 2015 Cuvée Alix  (Bordeaux Supérieur),Château Panchille,Red,Cuvée Alix,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux Supérieur, Bordeaux, France",14%,$20,87,Roger Voss,The wine is structured while also juicy.

Twisted Oak 2006 %@#$! White (Sierra Foothills),Twisted Oak,White,%@#$!,Rhône-style White Blend,"Sierra Foothills, Sierra Foothills, California, US",13.6%,$24,90,,"The honeyed aroma of this Rhône blend of Marsanne, Roussanne, Rolle and Viognier makes it immediately attractive, but then the flavors kick in, and it turns into a roller coaster ride. Apricot jam, peaches, pears, pineapples, butter-sautéed plaintain, vanilla custard, star anise, lemon crème brûlée, the list goes on and on. The finish is fully dry and the alcohol is refreshingly low. Drink now."
Domaine de Bel-Air 2016 Les Burdelines  (Moulin-à-Vent),Domaine de Bel-Air,Red,Les Burdelines,Gamay,"Moulin-à-Vent, Beaujolais, France",13.5%,$21,90,Roger Voss,"A perfumed wine, this is rich in tannins and generous, ripe black fruits. Aged nine months in wood, it has a hint of caramel as well as spice that adds extra dimension. It is juicy, ripe and needs to age further. Drink from late 2018."

Claiborne & Churchill 2000 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),Claiborne & Churchill,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",,$20,88,,"Bright strawberry-rhubarb fruit, toast, orange and pine aromas open this light but flavorful wine. The almost candied cherry fruit wears a black oak veil, but is strong enough to not be completely buried by it. Finishes long, with coffee and cocoa accents."
Burmester NV 20-Year-Old White  (Port),Burmester,Port/Sherry,20-Year-Old White,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,,91,Roger Voss,"With its fine aged-wood and fruit character, this is a sweet yet complex wine. Toast, almonds, a hint of spirit and the palate and delicate acidity all combine easily in a harmonious wine whose closest comparison is with a great amontillado."
Encosta do Sobral 2017 Reserva Branco White (Tejo),Encosta do Sobral,White,Reserva Branco,Portuguese White,"Tejo, Portugal",13%,$18,85,Roger Voss,"A ripe, creamy-textured wine, this is full of ripe pear and crisp quince flavors.

Folkway 2007 Revelator Red (California),Folkway,Red,Revelator,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"California, California Other, California, US",14.5%,$26,90,,"Mainly Merlot, this Bordeaux blend is a combination of grapes from Santa Maria Valley and the Santa Cruz Mountains. It's very rich and likeable now for its crisply acidic flavors of black cherries, red currants and spices, coated with sweet, smoky oak. Give it a brief decant before serving."
Bearboat 2006 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Bearboat,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$22,89,,"A very nice Pinot, actually Bearboat's best yet, that shows the dry silkiness of a fine Russian River Pinot, and also some complex layers of flavor.

Domaine de Chevalier 2010  Pessac-Léognan,Domaine de Chevalier,White,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,$132,96,Roger Voss,"This is a great wine with its swathes of ripe fruit allied to a very structured character. It is concentrated with complex flavors that bring in wood, tropical fruits, apricots and a dense texture. Combined, these elements give the wine great style and aging potential."
Vincent Grall 2017  Sancerre,Vincent Grall,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sancerre, Loire Valley, France",13%,$22,88,Roger Voss,"Lively acidity and crisp fruits mark out this attractive wine. It conveys citrus and bright lemon fruitiness, with a fresh aftertaste. Drink this lightly textured wine now."

This concentrated wine needs to age many years. Drink from 2025."
Blackbird Vineyards 2010 Contrarian Red (Napa Valley),Blackbird Vineyards,Red,Contrarian,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$125,94,,"So soft and dense in richness, this is easy to enjoy now. But you really want to restrain that impulse and give it some time in the cellar. Blended from roughly equal parts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, it's dry and tannic, but with a molten core of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, anise and sweet new oak. Very fine, very elaborate and complex. Give it 5–6 years, at least. This wine could still be unfolding in 2020."
Kenneth Volk 2006 Garey Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),Kenneth Volk,Red,Garey Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.9%,$48,85,,"Despite some tasty cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors, this Pinot Noir is too soft. It melts in the mouth, and the imbalance emphasizes the alcohol, which gives the impression of heat. Drink now."
Jean Becker 2016 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Jean Becker,White,Schoenenbourg Grand Cru,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Juicy, mellow apple, dried apple skin and dried lemon rind make for a rich and mellow nose on this vivid wine. The palate redoubles on creamy, zesty mellowness reminiscent of tart, baked apple flesh. All is made vibrant with lemon acidity and the finish is rounded but bone dry. The wine is intense and rich, but svelte."
Woodenhead 2012 Dolinsek Ranch Syrah (Russian River Valley),Woodenhead,Red,Dolinsek Ranch,,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",15%,$40,88,Virginie Boone,"Licorice and leather stand out in this softly layered wine that leans heavy on the palate. Made in a full-bodied, brawny style, it's single-minded more than complex, finishing in toasty oak and black pepper."
Tenuta L'Illuminata 2014 Sant'Anna  (Barolo),Tenuta L'Illuminata,Red,Sant'Anna,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$65,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with aromas of red berry, underbrush and a whiff of eucalyptus.

Château Pibran 2019 Barrel Sample  (Pauillac),Château Pibran,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France",,,91,Roger Voss,"90–92. Barrel Sample.

The blend with Merlot gives plenty of ripe fruit with smooth tannins and an attractive medium-term potential."

McBride,Red,Filigreen Farm The China Block,Pinot Noir,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14.2%,$32,89,Jim Gordon,"Plush and full-flavored, this ripe and fruity wine tastes like black cherries and red-cherry jam, has a smooth, lightly tannic texture and soft acidity."
Tegernseerhof 2015 Bergdistel Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),Tegernseerhof,White,Bergdistel Smaragd,Grüner Veltliner,"Wachau, Austria",13%,$30,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The nose hints at ripe fruit but it is on the palate that the wine's textured yeasty fullness becomes apparent. This is edged with the tang of grapefruit peel which encapsulates very ripe rounded fluid pear fruit on a concentrated palate. This is compact and impactful and finishes with pleasant, lip-smacking freshness."
Rubiejo 2004 Oak Aged  (Ribera del Duero),Rubiejo,Red,Oak Aged,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$17,89,Michael Schachner,"Wines like this are good indicators that 2004 is indeed an exceptional vintage in RdD. For a Tempranillo that spent only five months in oak it's fairly settled. The nose is a touch syrupy but you can only love the concentrated berry aromas. The mouth is bulky but satisfying, with huge dark-fruit flavors and balancing tannins and acidity. Jumpy but very likable."
Jean-Luc Baldès 2013 Clos Triguedina Les Selections Parcellaires Les Galets  (Cahors),Jean-Luc Baldès,Red,Clos Triguedina Les Selections Parcellaires Les Galets,Malbec,"Cahors, Southwest France, France",13.5%,$49,94,Roger Voss,"This third-terrace parcel in the Baldès terroir Trilogie is clay and limestone with iron and lava deposits.

Baricci 2007  Brunello di Montalcino,Baricci,Red,,"Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese","Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$40,89,,"The wine is subdued and clean on the nose and it doesn't exaggerate or mask the quality of fruit. This is executed in a bright, compact and streamlined style that combines freshness and firmness."
Vignobles Berthier 2012 Cuvée Jean-Marie Berthier  (Pouilly-Fumé),Vignobles Berthier,White,Cuvée Jean-Marie Berthier,Sauvignon Blanc,"Pouilly-Fumé, Loire Valley, France",12.5%,$26,89,Roger Voss,"A crisp, fresh and creamy wine, it has grapefruit acidity and a firm sense of mineral structure. The wine is developing well, but to bring out its balance between fruit and texture, it needs until 2015 in bottle."
Emile Beyer 2017 Tradition Riesling (Alsace),Emile Beyer,White,Tradition,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$22,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The subtle nose of this wine shows notions of vine peach and rhubarb. On the palate, the full impact of the fruit comes across, with red apple, lime zest and juicy peach cut with zesty citrus. This wine is lively, full fruited, refreshing and dry. The finish is vivid and lastingly zesty."
Arthur Metz 2018 Riesling (Alsace),Arthur Metz,White,,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12%,$25,86,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A slight note of Golden Delicious apple plays on the nose of this wine. The palate picks up this fruity notion in a juicy, easy flow. The light, smooth palate comes to a dry, slightly bitter finish."
Abbazia Santa Anastasia 1998 Montenero Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),Abbazia Santa Anastasia,Red,Montenero,"Nero d'Avola, Italian Red","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13%,$34,90,,"This New Wave wine from Sicily is a blend of 70% Nero d'Avola, 20% Syrah and 10% Merlot. Aromas of vanilla buttercream, cedar, cinnamon and clove make one wonder if the fruit has been oaked into submission, but the bright cherry fruit shines on the palate and lingers through the tart, smooth finish. Soft enough to drink now, but should get better through at least 2005 and drink well until 2010."
Nora 2010 Nora da Neve Albariño (Rías Baixas),Nora,White,Nora da Neve,Albariño,"Rías Baixas, Galicia, Spain",13%,$25,89,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of candle wax, nectarine and lees carry the bouquet on this well-aged Albariño that's round and full in body. Flavors of baked apple, citrus, almond skins and vanilla are briny, while the finish feels and tastes creamy and leesy. Drink now."
Villa Giada 2004 Andrea  (Moscato d'Asti),Villa Giada,Sparkling,Andrea,"Moscato, Muscat","Moscato d'Asti, Piedmont, Italy",7%,$15,86,,"Classic Muscat muskiness greets the nose and is followed by grass, citrus, dried flowers and rubber. The dried flower notes are particularly attractive and beg for hazelnut tarts, as producer Andrea Faccio suggests. Imported by Vin Divino."
Tenuta Carretta 2007 Bric Quercia  (Barbera d'Alba),Tenuta Carretta,Red,Bric Quercia,Barbera,"Barbera d'Alba, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$22,87,,"Liquid smoke and toasted elements of roasted hazelnut and cured meat dominate the nose of this modern Barbera d'Alba. There is power and high alcohol here too, coupled by the wine's naturally high acidity that is a bit strong on the palate. Pair this wine with very cheesey foods."

It oozes charm, and hides its power underneath its seductive exterior. There is great fruit here, with some hints of acidity as well as flavors of lychees and pepper."
Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Teurons Premier Cru  (Beaune),Chanson Père et Fils,Red,Teurons Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Beaune, Burgundy, France",13%,$69,93,Roger Voss,"Rich in character, this is a dense wine, with smoky tannins and juicy red fruits that are deliciously ripe. The tannins and the fruit concentration result in a weighty yet brightly acidic wine. It will develop quickly, and then remain at a peak for many years. Drink from 2018."
Buttonwood Farm 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),Buttonwood Farm,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$14,85,,"Dry and grassy, with high acidity that makes the palate clean and zesty. The lemon, lime, grapefruit and floral flavors finish with a scour of peppery spice."
Small Vines 2010 MK Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Small Vines,Red,MK Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14%,$71,92,,"Gentle and silky, this Pinot Noir has perfumes of rose petals, ripe red cherries, flat cola and sandalwood, plus a hint of grilled bacon. It tastes as sweetly delicious as it smells, and it feels round, supple and polished. So easy to drink now, but you might miss the complexity if you do."
Lavradores de Feitoria 2012 Red (Douro),Lavradores de Feitoria,Red,,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",13%,$12,85,Roger Voss,"Just fruit, this young wine shows attractive blackberry flavors and soft tannins. It's ripe and juicy, fresh while also rich. Drink now."
Federico Paternina 2010 Clisos  (Rioja),Federico Paternina,Red,Clisos,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$10,83,Michael Schachner,"Generic red fruit and milk chocolate aromas precede a tangy palate with a fairly high acid-to-body ratio. This tastes of tart red plum, with a hint of chocolate; it's short, crisp and quaffable. Novo Imports and Aidil Wines &amp; Liquors."
Jean-Luc Colombo 2005 Les Bartavelles Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),Jean-Luc Colombo,Red,Les Bartavelles,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rhône Valley, France",13.5%,$34,87,Joe Czerwinski,"Although the varietal composition isn't typical of Châteauneuf (one-third each Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre), the flavors certainly are, combining baked fruit with dusty earth and touches of leather and spice. It's soft and round in the mouth, with a juicy, mouthwatering finish. Drink now-2015."
Naughty Boy 2013 Thornton Ranch Chardonnay (Potter Valley),Naughty Boy,White,Thornton Ranch,Chardonnay,"Potter Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",12.8%,$15,84,Jim Gordon,"A straightforward and light-bodied wine, this has buttery, earthy aromas, and butter and apple flavors on a rather crisp texture. It turns dry and a bit sharp on the finish."
Marquee 2006 Signature Chardonnay (Yarra Valley),Marquee,White,Signature,Chardonnay,"Yarra Valley, Victoria, Australia",12.6%,$15,83,Joe Czerwinski,"Shows some rather lactic overtones to go with ample citrus and guava flavors. Medium-bodied, with a fresh, lemony finish."
Voerzio Martini 2013 La Serra  (Barolo),Voerzio Martini,Red,La Serra,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$105,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of exotic spice, red berry, crushed dill, espresso and a whiff of coconut lead the nose. The rounded polished palate offers black raspberry, dark cherry, vanilla, coffee and a hint of anise alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2021–2028."
Château Lalande Villeneuve 2014  Médoc,Château Lalande Villeneuve,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Médoc, Bordeaux, France",13%,$45,84,Roger Voss,"Vineyards in the northern Médoc have produced a wine that while offering some attractive black-currant fruit also has an excess of wood flavors. At this stage, the fruit should be more prominent and the wine possibly will remain toasty and woody."
Wild Hare 2012 Legendary Pinot Noir (California),Wild Hare,Red,Legendary,Pinot Noir,"California, California Other, California, US",13.5%,$10,81,,"Hard to like this Pinot. It has flavors of beets, cola and asparagus, but it's drinkable."
William Heritage 2016 Pumpkin Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Outer Coastal Plain),William Heritage,White,Pumpkin Hill Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Outer Coastal Plain, New Jersey, US",12.5%,$35,88,Fiona Adams,"This Chardonnay opens with alluring aromas of vanilla, lemon curd, dried apricot and pie crust. Lemon-lime acidity pulls together flavors of ripe peach and vanilla, with a hint of wood spice. Lime peel and spice linger on the fruity finish."
Santos & Seixo 2015 Rotas de Portugal Tinto Red (Alentejano),Santos & Seixo,Red,Rotas de Portugal Tinto,Portuguese Red,"Alentejano, Portugal",13.5%,$9,86,Roger Voss,"The wine is ripe, full of the Alentejo warmth while still having enough smoke and spice flavors to paint a contrast. The acidity and the full aftertaste give a rich finish."
Scotto Family Cellars 2016 Reserve Mohr-Fry Ranch Zinfandel (Lodi),Scotto Family Cellars,Red,Reserve Mohr-Fry Ranch,Zinfandel,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",13.5%,$20,92,Jim Gordon,"Great balance and subtle complexity give this full-bodied wine an extra level of enjoyment. Vivid black cherry and blackberry mingle with light earth and oak nuances while moderate tannins and mild acidity support the texture. More than just a gulper, this wine has many attributes to savor."
William Grassie NV Millésimes Mélangés Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),William Grassie,Red,Millésimes Mélangés,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.4%,$26,87,Paul Gregutt,"This is a blend of wines from their 2011 and 2012 vintages, mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with a bit of Merlot, as well. Spicy cherry fruit combines with herbal notes and a hint of balsamic. It has an earthy undertone, but overall the fruit shines."
Maximin Grünhäuser 2010 Abtsberg Alte Reben Trocken Riesling (Mosel),Maximin Grünhäuser,White,Abtsberg Alte Reben Trocken,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",11.5%,$48,91,Joe Czerwinski,"Hints of peach and clover give this medium-bodied dry Riesling a warm, sunny gloss, although it's still a racy, crisp wine laced with crushed stone and tart fruit notes of passion fruit and quince."
Sanguis 2014 Loner Favonius Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),Sanguis,White,Loner Favonius Bien Nacido Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.8%,$60,93,Matt Kettmann,"There are strong hints of smoke and flint at first on the nose of this bottling, but then comes a tighter mandarin orange pith character and a warming sandalwood spice. It's very fresh, tightly wound and bright on the palate, with pink grapefruit, squeezed lemon and lime skin toward the finish."
Château Ferran 2019 Barrel Sample  (Pessac-Léognan),Château Ferran,White,Barrel Sample,,"Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,,90,Roger Voss,"89–91. Barrel Sample. This soft wine is comfortably fruity and is already open and accessible. Its attractive white fruits, a shot of citrus and light minerality are integrating with the light wood spice."
Eder 2018 Smaragd Traminer (Wachau),Eder,White,Smaragd,"Traminer, Other White","Wachau, Austria",16%,$38,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Lemon freshness surrounds the pure Damask rose notes on the nose which become more intense with air. Intensity also is the watchword on the concentrated, almost oily palate but this richness is countered by the bone-dry style and the vivid, orange zest freshness. There is a lovely peppery savor on the long, mouthwatering finish."
Foley 2011 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Foley,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.2%,$40,91,Matt Kettmann,"Coming from the dramatic Lindsay's Vineyard, which rises from 500 to 1,000 feet in the Sta. Rita Hills, this highly nuanced wine overdelivers on multiple fronts. The nose mixes floral notes of violet and rose with an herbal tone of dried oregano, alongside fruity sour cherry. On the palate, there's graphite, espresso, purple flowers like lavender and a tad of tobacco, both fresh and smoked."
Produttori del Barbaresco 2001  Barbaresco,Produttori del Barbaresco,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$33,87,Joe Czerwinski,"A solid effort from Barbaresco's local cooperative, which should augur well for its single-vineyard riservas that will be released later this year. The normale is a fairly priced, somewhat herbal and tannic wine that shows enough cherry fruit and minty complexity to anchor it in the Very Good range. Astringent on the finish, so give it some time in the cellar or drink with rare beef. Imported by Vias Imports."
Château Vitallis 2010  Pouilly-Fuissé,Château Vitallis,White,,Chardonnay,"Pouilly-Fuissé, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$23,90,Roger Voss,"Soft, fruity and ripe, this is deliciously flavored with pear and melon notes. It opens slowly to reveal its wood aging and a hint of spice. Still developing, this needs 2–3 years of aging."
Leyendas de Familia 2011 Cachos de Oro Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Maule Valley),Leyendas de Familia,Red,Cachos de Oro,,"Maule Valley, Chile",13%,$36,88,Michael Schachner,"Woody, grainy aromas of fresh-cut timber relax with airing. in the mouth, this is drawn and a touch rough, with full tannins supporting rugged flavors of oak, wood resin, spice and black fruits. A nicely textured finish with rubbery notes and length is satisfying."
Kunde 2015 Wildwood Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),Kunde,White,Wildwood Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.3%,$30,90,Virginie Boone,"Dark gold in color, this estate-grown wine blends bright, crisp orange, melon and caramel apple flavors with richer toasted oak and vanilla notes."
Gianni Gagliardo 2016 Fossati  (Barolo),Gianni Gagliardo,Red,Fossati,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$113,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Subdued aromas of coconut, camphor and toasted notes mingle with underbrush. Firmly structured but lean in terms of fruit richness, the palate shows sour cherry, espresso and powdered sage set against assertive, grainy tannins that clench the finish."
Suhru 2012 Ember Red (North Fork of Long Island),Suhru,Red,Ember,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"North Fork of Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",13%,$20,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Lavish heaps of blackberries and cherries are accented by nuances of nuts, dried herb and black tea leaves in this composed red wine. Full bodied but balanced in acidity and fruit, it's substantial without overpowering. The finish lingers on velvety tannins."
Fairbank Sutton Grange 2015 Sangiovese (Bendigo),Fairbank Sutton Grange,Red,,Sangiovese,"Bendigo, Victoria, Australia",13%,$22,90,Christina Pickard,"Made from organically farmed vineyards, with native yeast and old barrels, this wine is a melting pot of bright cranberry and raspberry, smoke, toast, florals and sweet herbs. Medium bodied, with silky tannins, and plenty of terroir expression, it's well priced to boot. A win all around."
William Fèvre 2016 La Misión Reserva Especial Pinot Noir (Maipo Valley),William Fèvre,Red,La Misión Reserva Especial,Pinot Noir,"Maipo Valley, Chile",13.5%,$17,83,Michael Schachner,"Stale, sweaty aromas suggest old shoes and peanuts. In the mouth, this wine is raw and pulling, with no depth. Dry, leafy red-fruit flavors are lightly bitter and stewy, while an overall lack of ripeness is echoed on the finish."
Treleaven 2009 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Treleaven,White,Semi-Dry,Riesling,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12%,$14,85,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Aromatically restrained, with hints of green herbs, underripe apple and pineapple on the nose. It's semisweet in style, but brisk and approachable with pretty apple blossom and tart, green apple-skin flavors on the palate."
Rudolf Müller 2007 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),Rudolf Müller,White,Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett,Riesling,"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, Germany",8%,$14,85,Joe Czerwinski,"This smells like a typical Mosel kabinett, offering up hints of crushed stone and fresh flower-shop greenery. It's styled appropriately, with modest alcohol and a hint of residual sugar. It just lacks the extra flash of fruit and acidity needed to raise it to the next level, leaving it a good if somewhat commercial effort."
Nein Lives 2016 Riesling (Rheinhessen),Nein Lives,White,,Riesling,"Rheinhessen, Germany",9.5%,$10,87,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Delicate hints of yellow cherry and apple sweeten this uncomplicated but fresh wine. Off dry in style, it's pleasantly sweet and tart on a zesty lemonade finish. Drink now."
Black Stallion 2010 Estate Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Black Stallion,White,Estate,Chardonnay,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,VivinoGary's Wine,86,,"Dry, minerally and acidic, this Chardonnay offers pineapple, lemon and mineral flavors. It's a food-friendly wine that won't compete with what you eat. At this price, it's a good restaurant wine, and easy to find, with 7,500 cases produced."
Château les Mesclances 2016 Faustine Red (Côtes de Provence),Château les Mesclances,Red,Faustine,,"Côtes de Provence, Provence, France",14.5%,$26,90,Roger Voss,"This lush wine is full of generous black fruits and rich tannins. Spice, touches of wood and a full-bodied character give the wine warmth and great ripeness. The alcohol shows in the edge of pepper that gives a burnt aftertaste. Drink from 2020."
Michael David 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),Michael David,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",12.5%,$16,89,Jim Gordon,"Tasting fresh and vivid, this light-bodied wine exudes grassy citrusy aromas, followed by grapefruit, celery and scallion flavors that are assertive and refreshing. Good acidity keeps it lively."
Beresan 2006 Viuda Negra Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Beresan,Red,Viuda Negra Red,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$35,91,Paul Gregutt,This “Black Widow” blend of equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot was only made in 2005 and 2006. It's a fascinating combo—the Merlot giving breadth and flesh; the Cab Franc spotting in coffee and berry flavors.
Clement et Florian Berthier 2018 Le de Pépé Gamay (Coteaux du Giennois),Clement et Florian Berthier,Red,Le de Pépé,Gamay,"Coteaux du Giennois, Loire Valley, France",14%,$37,88,Roger Voss,"In this smooth, velvety wine, tannins are engulfed by ripe black fruits. Acidity and black-cherry flavors give freshness as well as a rich, open character. Drink from 2021."
Finca Flichman 2013 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),Finca Flichman,Red,Reserva,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,DrizlyVivino,88,Michael Schachner,"This is woodsy, spicy and narrow in its delivery of berry aromas. The palate is lively and shows acidic pick up. Full, generous berry flavors fade quickly then finish with a wave of minty, medicinal wood character."
Domaines Devillard 2015 Domaine de la Garenne  (Pouilly-Fuissé),Domaines Devillard,White,Domaine de la Garenne,Chardonnay,"Pouilly-Fuissé, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$37,89,Roger Voss,Citrus aromas reveal this wine's essentially crisp character. Plenty of acidity balances the rich white fruits while the mineral texture adds bite to this well-made wine. It will be ready to drink from 2019.
Tapestry 2002 Chardonnay (McLaren Vale),Tapestry,White,,Chardonnay,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",13%,$15,85,,"A racy wine, with a tart streak: Aromas are of pear, green apple and grapefruit. Feels clean in the mouth with citrus and peach fruit, and a hint of herb. Finishes with a peppery sourness. Bring a bottle to the raw bar."
San Felice 2008 Campogiovanni  (Brunello di Montalcino),San Felice,Red,Campogiovanni,"Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese","Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,VivinoGary's Wine,91,,"Inky dark concentration and bright cherry fruit open the nose of this nicely balanced Brunello. Leather, tobacco and cola notes give it aromatic momentum, and the wine shows bright acidity capped by firm tannins. Pair it with lamb or pork."
Agustí Torelló 2002 Kripta Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),Agustí Torelló,Sparkling,Kripta Gran Reserva Brut Nature,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Cava, Catalonia, Spain",11.5%,$45,90,Michael Schachner,"Austere in style, with a smooth nose and dry, short flavors of apple and citrus. Elegant, smooth and well made, although not as exciting and flavorful as Kripta, with its unique oblong bottle and wild labeling, has the potential to be. Recall: 2002 was not a great vintage in Spain."
La Bastide Saint Dominique 2003 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),La Bastide Saint Dominique,Red,,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rhône Valley, France",,$30,90,Roger Voss,"A finely structured wine, with dusty tannins, delicious fresh, purple fruits and fine acidity. Great perfumes set the scene for a poised, intense wine that is high in alcohol (15%) but does not taste like it. Imported by Simon N Cellars."
L'Antica Quercia 2007 Matiú Brut  (Prosecco di Conegliano),L'Antica Quercia,Sparkling,Matiú Brut,"Prosecco, Sparkling","Prosecco di Conegliano, Veneto, Italy",11.5%,$12,86,,The wine's golden hue tells you this is Prosecco from a warmer climate (Conegliano is a few degrees warmer than Valdobbiadene) as do its aromas of mature peach and honeysuckle. The wine tastes flat and big in the mouth and offers sophisticated notes of white pepper and spice.
Prinz Salm 2017 Two Princes Riesling (Rheinhessen),Prinz Salm,White,Two Princes,Riesling,"Rheinhessen, Germany",10.5%,$20,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Intense lemon and lime flavors are accented by hints of mineral in this off-dry Riesling. Racy acidity is balanced elegantly by a lavish, silky mouthfeel and long, clinging finish. Enjoy now–2021."
Fratelli Martini 2005 Canti  (Gavi),Fratelli Martini,White,Canti,"Cortese, Italian White","Gavi, Piedmont, Italy",12.5%,$13,82,,"The Canti suffers from a lack of acidity, which mars the pleasant minerality and apricot jam flavors of the wine. The low acid gives the wine little presence on the palate, and a short finish."
Knudsen 2016 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Knudsen,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.1%,$55,91,Paul Gregutt,"A light and lovely mix of red fruits, this also shows a streak of chicken stock, dried straw and moderate acids. It spent 16 months in 20% new French oak."
Les Parcelles de Stéphane Derenoncourt 2012  Bordeaux,Les Parcelles de Stéphane Derenoncourt,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",13%,$15,87,Roger Voss,"Rich and smooth, this solid, ripe wine offers a good sense of structure. It has weight, dense tannins and a creamy texture. Drink from 2015."
Ökonomierat Rebholz 2007 Spätlese Gewürztraminer (Pfalz),Ökonomierat Rebholz,White,Spätlese,Gewürztraminer,"Pfalz, Germany",,$47,90,Joe Czerwinski,"Pfalz Gewürztraminer lacks the weight and richness of most Alsace examples, carrying less alcohol. This one shows the characteristic gingery-pepper spice of the variety combined with apple and pineapple fruit and a crisply focused but off-dry finish. It would make a top-notch foil for Indian cuisine."
Covey Run 2000 Barrel Select Merlot (Washington),Covey Run,Red,Barrel Select,Merlot,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$13,87,Paul Gregutt,"A blend that includes some Cabernet Sauvignon (11%) and Cab Franc (3%), which add a little muscle to a somewhat soft, forward Merlot vintage. Definitely aging quickly, and probably drinking its best right now. Soft cherry fruit with tomato leaf/herbal notes, and a chocolaty finish."
Argento 2008 Tarquino Malbec (Mendoza),Argento,Red,Tarquino,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13%,$10,84,Michael Schachner,"Earthy and leathery smelling, but very much on the light-bodied side for Malbec. The palate is angular and slightly acidic, with juicy, spicy red-cherry flavors. Racy and lean on the finish, with a final wash of cleansing acids."
Solar de Cambres 2014 Casa de Cambres Colheita Red (Douro),Solar de Cambres,Red,Casa de Cambres Colheita,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",13%,$12,84,Roger Voss,"This is a rustic wine with very ripe fruit that gives a red jelly flavor. It is simple, with a dry edge and acidity, ready to drink now."
St. Clement 2010 Oroppas Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),St. Clement,Red,Oroppas,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.8%,$55,85,,"Not a bad wine, but not particularly exciting. It has blackberry and cherry flavors, tinged with oak, but also some green, vegetal notes that prohibit aging. The finish is soft and sweet."
Wattle Creek 2017 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),Wattle Creek,Red,,Zinfandel,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",16%,$34,88,Virginie Boone,"This brawny, intensely ripe wine is dripping in red licorice, blackberry jam and seamless tannin, packing plenty of heat on the palate. Concentrated and soft, it finishes in high-toned acidity and a lasting touch of vanilla oak."
Mailly Grand Cru 2009 Exception Blanche Blanc de Blancs Brut  (Champagne),Mailly Grand Cru,Sparkling,Exception Blanche Blanc de Blancs Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$99,94,Roger Voss,"The tight, mineral edge has softened just enough to make this Champagne drinkable now, although it will certainly age. Crisp apple and grapefruit flavors will develop well and the wine will be at its best from 2022."
Tre Nova 2009 Ripasso Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Tre Nova,Red,Ripasso,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$20,89,Paul Gregutt,"Barbera, Sangiovese and Nebbiolo comprise the wine. Half of the grapes were air dried for three months, which is known as appassimento. The Sangiovese was crushed and fermented conventionally before being added to the blend. The result is a dry, slightly nutty red wine, with tart flavors that are suggestive of fruit leather. It shows good grip and length, and it comes with just a bit of alcoholic heat."
Château de Coulaine 2015 La Diablesse  (Chinon),Château de Coulaine,Red,La Diablesse,Cabernet Franc,"Chinon, Loire Valley, France",13%,$36,91,Roger Voss,"Dating to the 14th century, this estate is now run organically. Dense and richly fruity, this is one of the property's top wines, packed with tannins that complement ripe cherry and black-currant flavors. The wine's still-fresh acidity suggests further aging, so wait until 2020."
Arrocal 2018  Ribera del Duero,Arrocal,Red,,"Tinto Fino, Tempranillo","Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$19,88,Michael Schachner,"Plum and berry aromas are a bit jammy, while a grapy mouthfeel features chewy tannins and just enough acidity. Blackberry and prune flavors finish with a note of raisin and a hint of soy sauce. This spent eight months in oak. Drink now."
Thorntree 2004 Chardonnay (Western Cape),Thorntree,White,,Chardonnay,"Western Cape, South Africa",13.5%,$9,85,,"Melon and grassy aromas waft from the glass. The palate delivers plenty of green melon and crème brûlée flavors. Thefeel is a little oily. Despite its texture, there is still enough acidity to match this with plenty of foods. Imported by Cape Wine Ventures."
College Cellars 2014 Cockburn Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),College Cellars,White,Cockburn Ranch Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.5%,$20,89,Sean P. Sullivan,"There's plenty of appeal to the aromas, with notes of toast, spice and peach. The palate offers sweet, lightly creamy-feeling stone and tropical-fruit flavors that convey balance. The barrel influence (new 500L puncheon) is there but doesn't get in the way."
Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2013 Mirabilis Grand Reserva White (Douro),Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo,White,Mirabilis Grand Reserva,Portuguese White,"Douro, Portugal",14%,,89,Roger Voss,"Spicy wood-aging flavors dominate this wine. It is rich, almost too rich and pushy for its own good, seeming to be more opulent than previous vintages. Nutmeg dominates more than the pineapple and apricot fruit flavors. It could settle down, although it will always be larger than life."
Icaria 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Icaria,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14%,$30,87,,"With soft tannins framing herb-infused black cherry, cassis, green tea and oak flavors, this is a nice Cabernet to drink now. Give it an hour or so in a decanter to let it breathe."
Henry Fessy 2008 Beaujolais Villages Nouveau  (Beaujolais-Villages),Henry Fessy,Red,Beaujolais Villages Nouveau,Gamay,"Beaujolais-Villages, Beaujolais, France",12.5%,$17,87,Roger Voss,"Moving towards richness, with a smoked meat character, this offers a rounded, ripe texture. The blackberry flavors are layered with some tight tannins, and boosted by spice and vanilla. A definite for food."
Grove Mill 2001 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),Grove Mill,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13.5%,$23,90,Joe Czerwinski,"Grove Mill has been working hard on getting their Pinot Noir right, and the staff there have finally succeeded, crafting a lush, mouthfilling wine filled with black cherries and cocoa that linger elegantly on the long finish."
Sparkman 2017 Rainmaker Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),Sparkman,Red,Rainmaker,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$65,92,Sean P. Sullivan,"Almost all the fruit for this wine comes from Olsen Vineyard. Aromas of green herb are out front, followed by notes of violet, plum, dark chocolate, coffee and black currant. Chocolate, cherry and herb flavors follow. A snap of acidity, the hallmark of this vintage, ups the interest. Best after 2024."
Boroli 2004 Villero  (Barolo),Boroli,Red,Villero,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$71,93,,"Boroli presents yet another ace with its Villero. There's more to chew on here compared to your standard Barolo and the wine boasts roundness and power. It's a modern, luscious interpretation with creamy vanilla and soft spice lavished over aromas of wild berry and plum. It has the tannins to cut through béchamel sauce."
Caven 2015 Sassella La Priora Riserva  (Valtellina Superiore),Caven,Red,Sassella La Priora Riserva,Nebbiolo,"Valtellina Superiore, Lombardy, Italy",13%,$42,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"New leather, Alpine herb, violet and red berry aromas form the nose. Linear and firmly structured, the rather lean palate features pomegranate, sour cherry and star anise set against firm, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity."
Nectar Of The Dogs 2018 Princess Edition Rosé of Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),Nectar Of The Dogs,Rose,Princess Edition Rosé of,Pinot Noir,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",13%,$26,87,Matt Kettmann,"Aromas of bruised watermelon, a hint of kirsch and a touch of muddy earth show on the nose of this bottling. The palate combines tea, dried cherry and clay, with lots of acidity and a firm texture."
Domaine Vallet 2017 Muletiers  (Saint-Joseph),Domaine Vallet,Red,Muletiers,,"Saint-Joseph, Rhône Valley, France",13%,$30,93,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Ebullient aromas of blackberry coulis, crushed pepper and violet introduce this hauntingly pretty Syrah sourced from 50-year-old vines. Made from 100% destemmed fruit and aged in 15 months en barrique (10–20% new), it's a glossy, intensely black-fruited sip wrapped in silky tannins. Irresistible in youth but should develop its more earthen, animal side as it matures through 2030."
Chatter Creek 2007 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),Chatter Creek,White,,Viognier,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$24,86,Paul Gregutt,"This wine opens pleasantly with floral scents over tangy citrus fruit, especially lime. It's tart and juicy, but it seems to close down in the back, and there is an impression of light toast, unexpected in a Viognier."
Jaffelin 2010 Passetemps Premier Cru  (Santenay),Jaffelin,White,Passetemps Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Santenay, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$41,87,Roger Voss,"Round and soft, this warm wine from the southern end of the Côte de Beaune feels rich and generous. It has caramel and yellow fruit flavors, and its crisp acidity will ensure that it will remain fresh and fruity."

Tait Wines 2014 The Wild Ride Red (Barossa Valley),Tait Wines,Red,The Wild Ride,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",15.5%,$20,90,Christina Pickard,"Despite the steep 15.5% alcohol that adds some heat, this blend has a lot to offer. On the nose, ripe red currant and cranberry fruit mingles with more savory, earthy characters of green olive, tobacco and eucalyptus. The palate is grainy in textured, with a strong savory current propelled by soft, supple tannins and bright acidity."
Burmester NV Port Jockey Club  (Port),Burmester,Port/Sherry,Port Jockey Club,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,$20,84,Roger Voss,"Light in color and lightly textured, this is a toffee and red-fruit flavored wine that is sweet without great definition."
Carmel 2007 Sha'al Single Vineyard Late Harvest Gewürztraminer (Galilee),Carmel,Dessert,Sha'al Single Vineyard Late Harvest,Gewürztraminer,"Galilee, Israel",10.5%,$26,90,Lauren Buzzeo,"This late harvest selection boasts ripe apricot, lychee, golden raisin, honeydew and baked apple fruit characters alongside glimmers of sweet spice, candied orange rind and raw honeycomb.

Once difficult to control, this grape can now produce richly structured wines, as it does here. This is packed with as much fruit as tannin—ripe fruit giving red-berry flavors that are bursting with juice as well as acidity. Drink this wine from 2018."

The mouthfeel is soft and medium in intensity."

Savannah-Chanelle 2001 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),Savannah-Chanelle,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",,$20,84,,"Cola-like in flavor, with earthier notes of tobacco and leather.

Sullivan,"This is fascinating—an Oregon side of the Columbia Valley Merlot in a Rhône-shaped bottle released extremely early with the oak pulled way back. Aromas of red plum, muscat gummy and pomegranate lead to pleasantly pure, textured, layered fruit flavors. It's a radically different interpretation of this variety. Give it a bit of additional time in bottle or decant to see it at its best."

Barrel Sample. The second wine of classed growth Calon Ségur, this is becoming impressive in its own right.

The palate comes in with ripeness, roundness and vigor but also more of that creaminess. Underneath it all there is a wonderful vein of lemon that is the guiding light until the very long finish. Concentration and texture enhance each other here, all homing in on that citrus zestiness."
Château Lauduc 2011 Château Lauduc Classic  (Bordeaux),Château Lauduc,Red,Château Lauduc Classic,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",,,84,Roger Voss,"This wine is very fresh and forward with its acidity and green bell-pepper flavors. The black currant flavors show some potential, but this is not a wine for aging."
Michele Chiarlo 2015 Le Marne  (Gavi),Michele Chiarlo,White,Le Marne,"Cortese, Italian White","Gavi, Piedmont, Italy",12%,$18,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Delicate scents of honeydew melon, orchard fruit and a whisper of white spring flower lift from the glass.

Gunn Estate 2007 Silistria Syrah (Hawke's Bay),Gunn Estate,Red,Silistria,,"Hawke's Bay, New Zealand",13%,$30,87,Joe Czerwinski,"This Syrah is really attractive upfront, with aromas of sweet pastry crust, baked plum, licorice and cracked pepper. The plum and blackberry fruit is balanced by some savory elements on the palate, which doesn't show a lot of weight or length. A pretty wine to drink over the next couple of years."

Dried cherry and apricot flavors mix with pepper and tobacco on the palate, while the finish is warm and accented by vanilla. Imported by Palm Bay Imports."
Château Haut-Beauséjour 1997 Cru Bourgeois  (Saint-Estèphe),Château Haut-Beauséjour,Red,Cru Bourgeois,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Estèphe, Bordeaux, France",12.5%,$23,85,,"A much less dense wine than either '95 or '96, reflecting the vintage.

Maison Champy 2014 Premier Cru  (Beaune),Maison Champy,Red,Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Beaune, Burgundy, France",13%,$55,92,Roger Voss,"Still quite closed, this is a firm wine with all its tight tannins still in place. It's dry at this stage, although the fruit is going to develop well. Acidity and a hint of perfumed red-berry flavors promise a good future. Drink from 2020."
Knudsen 2016 Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),Knudsen,White,,Chardonnay,"Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$45,92,Paul Gregutt,"Here's a big, full-throttle, wide-open style of Chardonnay. It's richly aromatic, deep gold in hue, and loaded with ripe tree fruits. Toasty and flavorful, it's cloaked in a rich dressing of buttered nuts. It was aged for 11 months in one-quarter new French oak, and is drinking beautifully at this relatively young age."
Scarlet of Paris 2015 Rosé (Vin de France),Scarlet of Paris,Rose,,Rosé,"Vin de France, France Other, France",12%,$10,84,Lauren Buzzeo,"This is a ripe and fruity rosé, with forward notes of lychee, rose water, peach gummies and tropical fruit salad. The palate is round and plump in similarly rich fruit flavors, with just enough acidity to keep it from feeling completely flat. Drink up."
Andrew Murray 2008 McGinley Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),Andrew Murray,Red,McGinley Vineyard,,"Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$36,90,,"Give this lush, rich Syrah two or three years to soften and develop in the bottle. It's a very good wine, offering impressive blackberry, blueberry and cherry-pie filling flavors, wrapped into fine acids and tannins. But it's fresh and young and will get better. Better well into 2011."
Valentín Bianchi 2006 Famiglia Bianchi Chardonnay,Valentín Bianchi,White,Famiglia Bianchi,Chardonnay,"Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.1%,$18,82,Michael Schachner,"Vanilla and floral aromas have a suspicious artificiality to them, and in the mouth it's a sweet, sugary ride toward a cloying finish."

Creamy feeling but also inky and fully concentrated, this tastes like black cherry and cough drops. Candied ripeness carries onto the finish along with chocolate and dry spice flavors. Drink through 2022."
Moonbase Cellars 2019 Les Collines Syrah Block 31 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Moonbase Cellars,Red,Les Collines Syrah Block 31,,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.6%,$48,92,Sean P. Sullivan,"This is an inaugural release from this producer, and it flat-out impresses. Coming from one of the valley's top Syrah sites, it was cofermented with 4% Viognier with two pick dates two weeks apart. The aromas are expressive, with piercingly pure notes of fresh raspberry, blueberry, violet, medicine, orange peel, smoked meat and dried herbs. The fruit flavors show a lot of density while retaining a sense of levity. It's yummy."
Wines & Winemakers 2016 Azul Portugal White (Palmela),Wines & Winemakers,White,Azul Portugal,Portuguese White,"Palmela, Portugal",12.5%,$12,85,Roger Voss,"Part of a range of wines that showcases the different styles of Portugal's regions, This wine is smooth, creamily textured and with a warm ripe character.

Rock Wall 2016 Alverd White (Yolo County),Rock Wall,White,Alverd,White Blend,"Yolo County, Central Valley, California, US",14.27%,$18,90,Jim Gordon,"An abundance of floral and savory flavors drives this full-bodied, dry and mouth-filling wine. It's not fruity per se, but has a good core of white peach along with almond and white-tea notes. This 50-50 blend of Albariño and Verdelho will bring a welcome change of pace to the table."
Pagter Brothers 2013 Pinot Noir (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),Pagter Brothers,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Paso Robles Willow Creek District, Central Coast, California, US",15.8%,$40,92,Matt Kettmann,"Made by brothers Scott and Gib Pagter, this rich wine is scented with sandalwood, strawberry, incense and chaparral shrub.

It opens with enticing aromas of woodland berry, rose, camphor, botanical herb and exotic spice while the elegantly structured palate doles out juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and cinnamon. Firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity keep it impeccably balanced. It's already tempting but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2024–2046."
Casar de Burbia 2015 Casar Godello (Bierzo),Casar de Burbia,White,Casar,"Godello, Spanish White","Bierzo, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,,88,Michael Schachner,"Tropical aromas suggest bath soap.

A dark earthy graphite-driven minerality contrasts with the brighter sweeter strawberry and cherry fruit on the nose, and then the bone-dry sip pops with a candied raspberry flavor, enhanced by fennel and white pepper."
Dion 2016 Winemaker's Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),Dion,Red,Winemaker's Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Chehalem Mountains, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.3%,$45,90,Paul Gregutt,"Chewy and tannic, this young wine is dense and a bit stiff. Black fruits, espresso and cacao combine to accent the dark flavors. It spent 18 months in half new French oak, and should continue to develop nicely over the next few years."
I Veroni 1999  Vin Santo del Chianti Rufina,I Veroni,White,,"Malvasia Bianca, Italian White","Vin Santo del Chianti Rufina, Tuscany, Italy",17%,$28,89,,"Dark amber in color, this sophisticated vin santo offers aromas of resin, pine nut, caramel candy, molasses, chestnuts, honey and dried apricots.

Sheridan Vineyard 2005 Syrah (Yakima Valley),Sheridan Vineyard,Red,,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$38,90,Paul Gregutt,"This flavorful, herbal Syrah spends its time in one-year-old oak; the reserve is made in 100% new oak. It is a pure, distinctive, cool-climate Syrah with a strong, dark, spicy, gamy streak of pungent flavor. It smells and tastes like ripe, almost raisined grapes, hung meat, boysenberry syrup, smoke, tar and coffee, all infused with wild herbs. Pay attention to the finish; that's where it really shines, as it slides through spice, earth, herb and, ultimately, into chocolate."
Elderton 2015 Neil Ashmead Grand Tourer Shiraz (Barossa Valley),Elderton,Red,Neil Ashmead Grand Tourer,,"Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",14.6%,$75,90,Christina Pickard,"Ripe cassis and blackberries are in the fore here, but they're backed by a meaty, smoky and earthy quality, along with a touch of warming baking spices that make this an instant wine for the wintertime. It's rich and powerful in style but also silky-textured with that intriguing and lingering core of savory smokiness and a spine of grainy tannins. This is just barely ready to drink now, but cellaring for up to 10 years should be pretty rewarding."
St Hallett 2008 Gamekeeper's Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa),St Hallett,Red,Gamekeeper's,,"Barossa, South Australia, Australia",14%,$13,88,Joe Czerwinski,"This entry-level red from St. Hallett displays ample cedar and cinnamon spice, cassis and plum fruit and judicious touches of mocha and vanilla, all framed by soft tannins and crisp, tangy acids.

Longboard 2010 Mavericks Goosechase Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Longboard,Red,Mavericks Goosechase Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$65,92,,"This is a seriously good Cabernet. You can stand it against anything in California and it will acquit itself with pride.

The result is a deliciously complex wine, dry, full-bodied and rich. Drink now–2016."

Silver Stone Winery 2000 Chardonnay (California),Silver Stone Winery,White,,Chardonnay,"California, California Other, California, US",,$9,84,,"Starts off with an interesting bouquet of honey, tapioca, peach, tropical fruit and vanilla, but it's disappointingly thin and hollow in the mouth. Leaves behind a faint fruitiness and lots of acidity."

There's real power to the baked black cherry and currant fruit, with all sorts of meaty, earthy, peppery nuances that linger long into the finish.

Château Clarke 2020 Barrel Sample  (Listrac-Médoc),Château Clarke,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Listrac-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",,,93,Roger Voss,"92–94. Barrel Sample.

The bright full-bodied palate delivers crushed raspberry, dark cherry, star anise and tobacco alongside firm refined tannins and vibrant acidity. It's already tempting but will be even better with more bottle age. Drink 2021–2033."
Banrock Station 2005 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),Banrock Station,White,,Chardonnay,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",13.5%,$5,84,,"This Chardonnay is fragrant and flavorful, full of easy, bright pineapple and peach flavors.

The palate is huge and grabby, with full extraction and immense flavors of blackberry, fig and cassis. This is flavor packed, but a bit soft and hot on the finish. Drink now through 2018."
Barale Fratelli 2004 Vigna Castellero Riserva  (Barolo),Barale Fratelli,Red,Vigna Castellero Riserva,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",,,91,,"Riserva Vigna Castellero is an approachable and elegant food wine with focused aromas of wild berry and cassis, backed by mineral, cola and powdered licorice. There's a polished and fine nature to the mouthfeel and the wine would stand up to juicy filet mignon topped with foie gras and mushroom pâté."
Quinta do Vesuvio 2012 Vintage  (Port),Quinta do Vesuvio,Port/Sherry,Vintage,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,$63,94,Roger Voss,"The power of this wine is palpable. Great swathes of rich berry fruits roll around the palate with a not-too-sweet juicy acidity. It is, of course, young, powered by tannins, sweet plum juice and an intensely ripe structure. It needs many years, so don't drink before 2030."
Narbona 2014 Blend 003 Red (Uruguay),Narbona,Red,Blend 003,"Red Blends, Red Blends",,13%,$24,82,Michael Schachner,"An opaque purple color and cooked, stewy aromas of beef soup and raisin are telling. Confirmation of a stewed wine comes on the palate, which is sappy and obese. Baked black fruit flavors are overweight throughout."
Sheldrake Point 2013 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),Sheldrake Point,White,,Gewürztraminer,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",14.3%,$18,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A touch of hibiscus nectar seems to sweeten this gorgeously floral, fruity Gewürztraminer.

Sappy and sexy, it hits the palate with rich flavors of apple sauce and peach pie, along with accents of toasted hazelnuts. Despite the implied decadence, it's firmly anchored in vivid acids that keep it lively."

Firm in tannins, juicy and swirling in vanilla and cinnamon toast flavors, it spent 22 months swaddled in French oak, an imprint that lets itself be known in the wine. Lay this baby down until 2015 or so, or let it breathe before enjoying with racks of ribs."
Carlisle 2014 Old Vines Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Carlisle,Red,Old Vines,Zinfandel,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",15%,$30,93,Virginie Boone,"This is a blend from several vineyard sites, including Banfield, Saitone, Carlisle, Montafi and Papera, each boasting more than 100-year-old vines. A chocolate cordial note dominates the palate, as bold cherry, rhubarb, cinnamon and citrus flavors wander in. It's a steal for the price, too."

Davies 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Davies,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$30,86,Virginie Boone,"From a trio of vineyards the winery otherwise vineyard-designates, including Spring Hill, Saltonstall and Nobles, this Pinot is rustic in truffled earth and dried herb, the earthiness of the Pommard clone grapes out in full force."
Château la Pointe 2008 Barrel sample  (Pomerol),Château la Pointe,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pomerol, Bordeaux, France",,,89,Roger Voss,"88-90 Barrel sample. Very sweet fruit, deliciously approachable. Chocolate and ripe black fruit. The layer of tannin is important to keep all this opulence together."
Umberto Cesari 2003 Riserva  (Sangiovese di Romagna),Umberto Cesari,Red,Riserva,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Sangiovese di Romagna, Central Italy, Italy",12.5%,$15,86,,"This wine has loads of balsam and menthol-like notes, which I find particularly attractive. Candied cherry almond and a brambly quality add more interesting layers. The wine's impression on the palate is balanced yet lean with spicy crispness and a sour note on the finish."
Château la Croix Melin 2008  Saint-Émilion,Château la Croix Melin,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",13%,$22,88,Roger Voss,"Soft and full in the mouth, with spice adding an extra dimension to the broad berry fruits.

You'll love the rich lime and peach flavors, with their hint of spearmint and vanilla and long, dry finish."
Malibràn 2012 Ruio Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),Malibràn,Sparkling,Ruio Brut,"Glera, Italian White","Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore, Veneto, Italy",11.5%,,87,,"Ruio Brut is a simple and clean Prosecco Superiore that offers peach, citrus and crushed mineral. The effervescence is soft and foamy but the finish is dryer than most Italian sparklers from the general Prosecco category."
Grimaldi Bruna 2013 Bricco Ambrogio  (Barolo),Grimaldi Bruna,Red,Bricco Ambrogio,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$65,93,Kerin O’Keefe,"Fragrant and refined, this shows enticing aromas of wild herb, rose petal, dark spice, red berry and a whiff of camphor. Luminous and elegant, the vibrant palate has juicy Marasca cherry, cranberry, star anise and white pepper while bright acidity and taut polished tannins provide the framework. It's still young but already possesses terrific poise. Drink 2021–2033."
Viña Leyda 2020 Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),Viña Leyda,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Leyda Valley, Chile",13%,$15,86,Michael Schachner,"Tutti-frutti berry aromas are medicinal like cherry cough drops and red licorice sticks. An inexact palate lacks structure, while this tastes of medicinal plum and raspberry prior to a lightweight finish."
De Bortoli NV Emeri Sparkling Pinot Grigio (Australia),De Bortoli,Sparkling,Emeri Sparkling,Pinot Grigio,"Australia, Australia Other, Australia",,$13,85,Joe Czerwinski,"De Bortoli's Emeri line of sparkling wines are not conventional Pinot Noir-Chardonnay blends. This one is Pinot Grigio with bubbles, the usually muted aromas of the variety perked up to show grapefruit and fig notes. The wine is soft and fullish in body, with hints of fig coming through on the palate."
Château Saint-Cernin 2017 No. 1 Saint-Cernin Red (Bergerac),Château Saint-Cernin,Red,No. 1 Saint-Cernin,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bergerac, Southwest France, France",14.5%,$95,92,Roger Voss,"A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a powerful, rich wine. The structure has now softened, giving perfumed and ripe black-fruit flavors. Touches of licorice and dark chocolate contrast the bold fruitiness. Drink now."
Zuccardi 2015 Tito Red (Paraje Altamira),Zuccardi,Red,Tito,,"Paraje Altamira, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$38,89,Michael Schachner,"Pointy, inky aromas are top-heavy and electric. Those characteristics carry over onto a shocked palate, which is jagged in feel due to hard tannins and blazing acidity. Plum and currant flavors are wide awake, while this Malbec blend tastes peppery and herbal on a fiery finish."
Cesari 2015 Cento Filari  (Lugana),Cesari,White,Cento Filari,White Blend,"Lugana, Lombardy, Italy",13%,$25,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"White spring flower and citrus aromas lead the way on this juicy, savory wine.

Peacock Family Vineyard 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),Peacock Family Vineyard,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Spring Mountain District, Napa, California, US",,$60,84,,"Some of the grapes got overripe during this remarkably long, dry, warm vintage, to judge from the raisiny aromas. Then, too, the wine has a hot mouthfeel and finish."
René Muré 2017 Clos St Landelin Pinot Noir (Alsace),René Muré,Red,Clos St Landelin,Pinot Noir,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$75,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,A gamy touch hangs over red-currant and tart cherry notes on the nose. The palate comes with subtle depth that brings forth an unexpected intensity of red fruit. Tannins are supple and fine; the body is slender and sinuous. This wine is elegant and lasting.
Cinco Tierras 2003 Malbec (Mendoza),Cinco Tierras,Red,,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.7%,$10,85,Michael Schachner,"Ripe and smoky, with attractive nuances to the forward bouquet. This is a nice wine with spunky plum flavors balanced by adequate but not overpowering oak. Cola, wood grain and toast notes help the finish along. Medium in weight and pure; mildly tannic. Imported by Mediterranean Wine Imports."
Ceretto 1995 Prapo  (Barolo),Ceretto,Red,Prapo,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",,$70,92,Michael Schachner,"A wonderful ready-to-drink Barolo with an amiable personality. Dark-cherry fruit is accented by a touch of orangey dryness; the body is amply weighty but not heavy. There's nothing here not to like, and once again, it's drinkable now. Belying the quality, this is a secondary wine from the sensational Bricco Roche vineyard."
Viña Arnáiz 2009 Roble  (Ribera del Duero),Viña Arnáiz,Red,Roble,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$18,88,Michael Schachner,"With dark aromas of prune, black tea and baked earth, this is a ripe, modern wine with sound balance and depth of flavor.

Totally dry and brisk in acidity, it has savory flavors of lemons and limes, passionfruit, gooseberries and white pepper. Awesome with Vietnamese, Ethiopian and Indian fare calling for white wine."
Fabre en Provence 2017 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),Fabre en Provence,Rose,,Rosé,"Côtes de Provence, Provence, France",13%,$13,86,Roger Voss,"For 17 generations, the Fabre family has been making wine in Provence. The latest vintage to bear their name is ripe and concentrated, a product of the hot, dry year. The rich red fruits have just the right amount of acidity and of tangy, zesty texture. Drink now."
Andeluna 2007 Winemaker's Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato),Andeluna,Red,Winemaker's Selection,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tupungato, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.2%,$10,83,Michael Schachner,"Adequate on the nose, with staid berry aromas. The palate is narrow and tart, with cherry flavors and edgy heat. And the finish doesn't really change the scene much. Too snappy and short on personality; a step down from previous vintages."
Stark-Condé 2005 Twin Peak Vineyard Unfined and Unfiltered Syrah (Jonkershoek Valley),Stark-Condé,Red,Twin Peak Vineyard Unfined and Unfiltered,,"Jonkershoek Valley, South Africa",14.5%,$35,88,Susan Kostrzewa,"A lovely nose of cedar, pepper and berry is followed by flavors of smoke, pepper and energetic fruit in this big red. A touch aggressive on first taste, the wine is rounded by good acidity and elegant spice layers."
Château Grand Destieu 2004  Saint-Émilion,Château Grand Destieu,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,89,Roger Voss,"A Merlot-based wine from old vines on the plains at the base of the hill of Saint-Emilion. This is soft and fresh, with an element of wood and smoky tannins to give structure and aging potential. The ripe, jammy fruit flavors are balanced by freshness and vibrant acidity."
Quinta da Lapa 2016 Reserva White (Tejo),Quinta da Lapa,White,Reserva,Portuguese White,"Tejo, Portugal",13.5%,$12,86,Roger Voss,"This soft wine is creamy and smooth thanks to the 35% of Chardonnay in the blend.

Sparkman 2007 Ruckus Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sparkman,Red,Ruckus,,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$38,91,Paul Gregutt,"This is three quarters Syrah, sourced from Klipsun, Hedges Bel Villa, and Lewis; with a touch of Merlot from the Meek vineyard. Dark, spicy and lush, its sappy fruit has a lively snap to it, with a hint of licorice and smoke. Not the funky “in the rocks” Walla Walla style of Syrah, this is for those who want the fruit forward, front and center."
Villa Sandi NV Opere Trevigiane Serenissima Metodo Classico Sparkling (Vino Spumante),Villa Sandi,Sparkling,Opere Trevigiane Serenissima Metodo Classico,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Vino Spumante, Italy Other, Italy",12%,,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of field flower, white stone fruit and a whiff of toasted bread crust lead the way.

DeLille 2016 Grand Ciel Syrah (Red Mountain),DeLille,Red,Grand Ciel,,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.1%,$75,91,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas suggest notes of iron, medicine and earth, along with dark berry. The palate has depth of flavor but with an acidic snap that ups the ante."
Clos du Val 1999 Palisade Vineyard Zinfandel (Stags Leap District),Clos du Val,Red,Palisade Vineyard,Zinfandel,"Stags Leap District, Napa, California, US",,$28,88,,"A single-vineyard Zin bursting with ripe, jammy red and black rasberry fruit and sweet , vanilla-tinged, smoky aromas from French oak.  Stresses elegance rather than weight or size, with pretty, melted tannins and a soft, velvety mouthfeel."
Cottanera 2011 Barbazzale  (Etna),Cottanera,Red,Barbazzale,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Etna, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13%,$14,88,,"Made from Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio, this shows bright berry aromas of blackberry and cassis, with cola, dried ginger and polished mineral notes.

Iijima,"Dried plums are perfumed by hints of anise and smoked meat in this rich, peppery Grenache-dominant red. Full bodied and plump on the palate, it balances ripe, opulent black fruit flavors with a fresh spine of acidity and plush, cocoapowder tannins. Ready now but should hold through 2024."
Sheldrake Point 2017 Estate Bottled Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),Sheldrake Point,White,Estate Bottled,,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12.9%,$16,85,Alexander Peartree,"Aromas of nearly wilted honeysuckle and lemon peel carry the nose. The palate is light in profile, with mild acidity pushing along apple and sharp citrus flavors. It ends a bit bitter on a candlewax note."
Barnett 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),Barnett,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Spring Mountain District, Napa, California, US",,VivinoWine.com,91,,"Here's a textbook Napa Cab. It's concentrated in black currant flavors, with the best tannic structure money can buy. Soft and elegant in the mouth, with a long, elegant finish. Could use some individuality, though, as it's firmly in the international style."
Piombaia 2016  Brunello di Montalcino,Piombaia,Red,,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$50,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of Mediterranean brush, cooking spice and dark-skinned berry set the tone.

The tangy palate delivers ripe apricot, grapefruit and crushed Mediterranean herb set against crisp acidity. It closes on a hint of brine."
Ferreira 1994 Traditional LBV  (Port),Ferreira,Port/Sherry,Traditional LBV,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20.5%,$20,89,Michael Schachner,"When a wine is as dense, plummy and pretty as this, you're in business. It's somewhat round and fat, but it's rightly balanced by driving cherry fruit and bitter chocolate. An LBV rich enough to top off vanilla ice cream yet vital enough to be drunk by the glass is a good thing to have in the house."
Château la Mascaronne 2020 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),Château la Mascaronne,Rose,,Rosé,"Côtes de Provence, Provence, France",13.5%,$30,90,Roger Voss,This pale-colored wine is ripe and full of wild strawberry flavors. Textured acidity gives spice and a saline tang that will soften as the wine ages a bit. Drink from late 2021. Organic.
La Tunella 2011 Picolit (Friuli Colli Orientali),La Tunella,Dessert,,"Picolit, Italian White","Friuli Colli Orientali, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13.5%,,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of chamomile flower, yellow peach and candied citrus zest lead the nose on this bright dessert wine. On the palate, notes of acacia honey, fig and sweet almond accent a core of mature apricot. Fresh acidity keeps it from being cloyingly sweet."
Domaine Charles Baur 2015 Sylvaner (Alsace),Domaine Charles Baur,White,,"Sylvaner, Other White","Alsace, Alsace, France",14%,$17,90,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Notes of ripe pear and dry hay appear on the open nose. The palate is light and fresh with lemon but also rounded by ripe pear juiciness. Purity, vividness and that lovely hay perfume are chief characteristics. The finish is off dry but balanced."
Smith-Madrone 2010 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Spring Mountain District),Smith-Madrone,White,Estate Bottled,Chardonnay,"Spring Mountain District, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$30,90,,"This Chardonnay has plenty of ripe pineapple, pear and tropical fruit flavors. Having aged in 100% new French oak barrels, it offers rich notes of vanilla and buttered toast. Like all of Smith-Madrone's wines, this has great acidity and minerality, and even some tannins. Give this some time, and see how it is after 2017."
Rasa 2009 Plus One Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),Rasa,Red,Plus One,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.4%,$75,90,Paul Gregutt,"Crisp and penetrating, with great fruit purity, the wine's core bears cassis and black cherry flavors.

The wood element is a little weighty at this point, but there's solid fruit to support it."
Koehler 2007 Oak Savanna Vineyard Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley),Koehler,Red,Oak Savanna Vineyard,Sangiovese,"Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.8%,$35,87,,"One of the better Sangioveses out there, because it avoids the pitfalls of unbalanced flavors and textures. It's a dry, crisply acidic wine that's ripe enough in cherries and cola to satisfy. Good job. The next step is to build in complexity."
Valtosca 2004 Syrah (Jumilla),Valtosca,Red,,,"Jumilla, Levante, Spain",14.9%,$23,90,Michael Schachner,"Really good and interesting Syrah, with chocolate, campfire, menthol and prune on the nose. With airing the wine quickly settles into a deep, smooth berry and chocolate groove, while the finish deals pure tannins and comfort. Ripe but not raisiny; a really nice example of Jumilla Syrah, with 4% Viognier blended in for lightness (and it still weighs in at 14.9%)."
Cameron Hughes 2006 Lot 58 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),Cameron Hughes,White,Lot 58,Chardonnay,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$14,84,,"With its crisp spine of acidity, this wine clearly comes from a cool climate. The flavors show long hang-time notes of ripe pineapples and pears. There's too much oak for balance, given the dominating blast of caramel, but the wine will appeal to many for the price."
J Wrigley 2016 828 Single Clone Estate Pinot Noir (McMinnville),J Wrigley,Red,828 Single Clone Estate,Pinot Noir,"McMinnville, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.8%,$68,91,Paul Gregutt,"Firm and precise, this pushes tart cranberry/raspberry fruit up front, with a seam of citrus oil and rind. Grapefruit highlights and lemony acidity flow into a lingering finish, with a comet's tail of chocolate."
Silvio Grasso 2016 Turnè  (Barolo),Silvio Grasso,Red,Turnè,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$50,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of iris, tobacco and underbrush lead the way.

Marquee 2005 Artisan Wines Classic Shiraz (Victoria),Marquee,Red,Artisan Wines Classic,,"Victoria, Victoria, Australia",13.9%,$10,83,Joe Czerwinski,"Light to medium in body, this red-fruited Shiraz is a bit simple, but offers extremely fruity, cherry-berry flavors. It verges on confected, then turns crisp on the finish."
Casa Ferreirinha 2018 Callabriga Red (Douro),Casa Ferreirinha,Red,Callabriga,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",13.5%,$40,91,Roger Voss,"Named after a Roman city that existed in the Douro region, this wine is impressively balanced, rich with both tannins and vanilla flavors.

Mount Mary 2004 Quintet Red (Yarra Valley),Mount Mary,Red,Quintet,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Yarra Valley, Victoria, Australia",13%,$145,89,Joe Czerwinski,"One of Australia's most expensive and sought-after Cabernet blends, Mount Mary's Quintet has failed to impress more than one American critic. It's an appealing, well-crafted wine that combines leather, cherry and dried herbs in a somewhat lean, crisp style that delivers a long, mineral-and-cedar finish."
Col Solare 2012 Red (Red Mountain),Col Solare,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.9%,$75,93,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon (85%) with the remainder Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Syrah. Reserved aromas of toast, high-toned herbs, coffee and blue and black fruit lead to dense, rich, structured dark fruit flavors that show depth along with vibrant acidity and a long finish. This wine is built for the long haul and will be best from 2021–2028."
M. Chapoutier 2016 Petite Ruche Marsanne (Crozes-Hermitage),M. Chapoutier,White,Petite Ruche,Marsanne,"Crozes-Hermitage, Rhône Valley, France",12.5%,$30,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Zesty and light footed, this dry varietal Marsanne offers a fresher expression of this typically lavishly textural grape. There's a delicacy to the palate marked by slightly creamy tones of fresh yellow apple, Asian pear and peach. The finish is rimmed by a pleasantly salty tone. Enjoy now–2022."
Deltetto 2018 del Comune di Gavi  (Gavi),Deltetto,White,del Comune di Gavi,"Cortese, Italian White","Gavi, Piedmont, Italy",12.5%,$20,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Green apple, citrus and spring blossom aromas waft out of the glass.

With its dryness and softness, the wine is delicious, if a little one-dimensional."
The Crossings 2011 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),The Crossings,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Marlborough, New Zealand",14%,$19,85,Joe Czerwinski,"Sourced from the cool Awatere Valley, this wine displays some of that region's characteristic leafiness. It also shows hints of cruciferous and root vegetables, medium body and crisp, red-fruit flavors on the finish."
Hosmer 2007 Cabernet Franc (Cayuga Lake),Hosmer,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"Cayuga Lake, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12.8%,$18,85,Susan Kostrzewa,"This bouyant red starts with red berry and spice aromas, leading into a balanced, pleasant array of red berry, black cherry and cedar on the palate.

Shooting Star 2004 Blue Franc Lemberger (Washington),Shooting Star,Red,Blue Franc,"Lemberger, Other Red","Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$12,88,Paul Gregutt,"Just a hint of horsey leather over dense, cherry liqueur flavors. The wine is earthy but carries it well, and the super-saturated fruit offers substantial flavors that carry the authority and taste of old vines."
Dashwood 2019 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),Dashwood,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13.5%,$18,86,Christina Pickard,"This fruity Pinot is packed with plush red berries quietly backed by savory spice. Although the palate has a softness and roundness, the astringency of both tannins and fruit is difficult to get past. It's a light- to medium-weight wine for everyday drinking."
Flam 2018 Classico Red (Judean Hills),Flam,Red,Classico,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Judean Hills, Israel",14%,$30,89,Mike DeSimone,"Aromas of black cherry and summer farm stand pave the way for flavors of blackberry, pomegranate, roasted tomato and green pepper.

Tastes herbal as well, as the wine's scouring acidity makes for a long but not very flavorful finish."
Alain Voge 2017 Ongrie White (Saint-Péray),Alain Voge,White,Ongrie,Rhône-style White Blend,"Saint-Péray, Rhône Valley, France",14%,$36,94,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Silky layers of sweet cream and honey seem to edge this full-bodied white sourced from Marsanne vines averaging 50 years old. While vinified in oak (30% new) and voluptuous in mouthfeel, it's a breathtaking, sunny sip balanced by pert Meyer lemon and tangerine acidity along with that classic salty finish. Ready now but should drink beautifully through 2030."
Henri Bourgeois 2009 Le M.D. de Bourgeois  (Sancerre),Henri Bourgeois,White,Le M.D. de Bourgeois,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sancerre, Loire Valley, France",,,93,Roger Voss,"This is great Sancerre from the Monts Damnés vineyard. It shows all the right varietal character, stylized by initial austerity, flint and a dense texture. Gradually it opens up to show a balance of acidity and richness."
Gunter Triebaumer 2017 Zweigelt (Burgenland),Gunter Triebaumer,Red,,"Zweigelt, Other Red","Burgenland, Austria",13%,$19,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A hint of vanilla appears amid notes of crushed black cherry and blackberry.

Château de la Rivière 2017 Barrel Sample  (Fronsac),Château de la Rivière,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Fronsac, Bordeaux, France",,,90,Roger Voss,"89–91. Barrel Sample.

The flavors are very cohesive and expertly woven on the palate, where bright red fruit is lifted by star anise spice and framed by a taut texture and uplifting acid. Stunning depth."
San Polino 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),San Polino,Red,Riserva,"Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese","Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",,$85,94,,"A rich and sophisticated wine, with loads of dark fruit and exotic spice.

Smoky wood-aging flavors give complexity that balances the ripe black currant fruitiness. It's still developing, so don't drink before 2018."
Wechsler 2016 Weissburgunder (Rheinhessen),Wechsler,White,,"Weissburgunder, Pinot Blanc","Rheinhessen, Germany",12.7%,$26,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A gorgeous array of mineral tones anchor this vivacious medium-bodied white wine. Ripe juicy tangerine and grapefruit flavors are accented by hints of pollen and dusty earth. While creamy and textured, it finishes lean with a bracing hit of lime acidity. Drink now through 2023."
Simi 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Simi,White,Reserve,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$26,90,Virginie Boone,"After an initial clarified butter aroma invites one in, this fleshy, full-bodied white is smooth and delicate, taking on body and weight as it develops in the glass.

Trivento 2006 Amado Sur Malbec (Mendoza),Trivento,Red,Amado Sur,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$15,87,Michael Schachner,"A standard but well-done red blend. The nose deals lively plum and blackberry aromas, but also a slight hint of pickle. It's juicy and ripe-feeling on the palate, where red-fruit flavors of plum, cherry and raspberry are dominant. Solid and warm on the finish, and healthy and honest overall. It's 75% Malbec with 15% Syrah and 10% Bonarda."

The wine follows with similar flavors. The light fruit flavors of plum and berry are quickly suffocated with leaf, herb, earth, spice and tannin. Time may be the answer."

Thomas Labille 2019  Chablis,Thomas Labille,White,,Chardonnay,"Chablis, Burgundy, France",13%,$26,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Streaks of honey and white melon introduce this creamy, fruit-forward Chablis. A decadently textured, almost lactic, sip, it is bolstered by sunny lemon and lime acidity and a cool tang of steel on the finish.

A bit shy and reserved at first, this opens up with some time and air to reveal brooding sensations of black plum, cherry, forest floor, wood spice and a touch of mentholated herb. It's bold, dense and powerful on the palate, with gripping tannins and black fruit-skin flavors that fill the mouth and carry through to the lightly charred, spicy finish.

Château Famaey 2014 Cuvée X  (Cahors),Château Famaey,Red,Cuvée X,Malbec,"Cahors, Southwest France, France",13%,$25,92,Roger Voss,"Produced from old vines and aged for two years in wood, this wine is still not quite ready to drink. Black fruits shine through the firm tannins and vanilla and spice flavors, but still need time. Licorice and dusty tannins give a perfumed character. Drink this rich wine from 2022."
Korbel NV Sweet Cuvée Sparkling (California),Korbel,Sparkling,Sweet Cuvée,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","California, California Other, California, US",11%,$14,86,,"Yes, this blend of Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay, French Colombard and Muscat Canelli is quite sweet, with sugary flavors of oranges, peaches, vanilla and toast. And yes, some people will turn their noses up at it. Too bad for them—it's an ideal wine for drinking at the beach or picnics, or celebrating just about anything."
D'Aria 2009 Terra D'Aria Sauvignon Blanc (Durbanville),D'Aria,White,Terra D'Aria,Sauvignon Blanc,"Durbanville, South Africa",13.5%,$12,87,Lauren Buzzeo,"Green plum skins, bitter lime pith, hay and pepper all dominate the nose with barely a hint of ripe fruit to be found. The mouth, however, offers a bit more ripeness to the lime and plum flavors, fleshing out the medium-weight mouth and adding depth to the wine."
Rex Hill 2006 Sims Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Rex Hill,Red,Sims Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,VivinoWine.com,90,Paul Gregutt,"A full, fleshy, lushly fruited Pinot Noir, streaked with espresso and caramel from barrel aging. The fruit and overall structure are up to the challenge of the wood; lots of black cherry and even hints of cassis running through the core. A finish with some noticeable heat supports the 15.4% alcohol reading, but it's a tasty bottle of wine."
Château la Gorce 2015  Médoc,Château la Gorce,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Médoc, Bordeaux, France",14%,,83,Roger Voss,"Heavily toasty, this wine seems to rely on the wood aging rather than fruit. It does have weight and hints of juicy black currants in the background, but too much wood has not done the wine any favors."
François Millet 2011 Empreinte Rouge  (Sancerre),François Millet,Red,Empreinte Rouge,Pinot Noir,"Sancerre, Loire Valley, France",13%,$28,87,Roger Voss,A softly fruity wine that is just strengthened by tannins with attractive red fruits as well as a more herbal character. Smooth texture leads to final acidity. The light structure promises aging until 2018.
Northwest Totem Cellars 2007 Low Man Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Northwest Totem Cellars,Red,Low Man,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$33,84,Paul Gregutt,"Aggressively tannic, this is an earthy red wine with a lot of barrel influence. The fruit vanishes into a mélange of pepper, clove, coffee and tannin."
Rocca delle Macìe 2008 Riserva Famiglia Zingarelli  (Chianti Classico),Rocca delle Macìe,Red,Riserva Famiglia Zingarelli,Sangiovese,"Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$24,90,,"Sangiovese is enhanced with tiny percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot to create a fresh, balanced wine, with aromas of red fruit and savory spice. The mouthfeel is soft and rich with good structure and fullness."
Cuneo 2001 Del Rio Vineyard Syrah (Rogue Valley),Cuneo,Red,Del Rio Vineyard,,"Rogue Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",14.5%,$25,86,Michael Schachner,"Rich and extracted, with a purple color and nutty, maple-based aromas. There's no denying the power here, and with flavors of sugar beets, smoked meats and kirsch, it's quite the bruiser. Despite that heft, the finish is balanced, with chocolate and dried herb flavors. Some hard tannins make it a bit tough now; maybe time will tame it."
Gloria Ferrer 2000 Pinot Noir (Carneros),Gloria Ferrer,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",13.6%,$24,85,,"Oak-derived vanilla, brown sugar and menthol aromas open yet another wine that's tasty, but doesn't show real vinous depth and intensity. Cherry fruit is hidden behind a powerful oak veneer, so a caramel quality prevails. Finishes tart and dry, with coffee flavors."
Vollereaux NV Brut Rosé de Saignée Pinot Noir (Champagne),Vollereaux,Sparkling,Brut Rosé de Saignée,Pinot Noir,"Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$40,88,Roger Voss,"Most rosé Champagnes get their color by the addition of red wine. This wine gets its hue from the skins of red grapes macerating before fermentation. It has a deep pink color and a lightly tannic character, making for a rich wine flavored with red currants and finished with acidity."
João Pires 1999 Muscat (Terras do Sado),João Pires,White,,Muscat,"Terras do Sado, Portugal",11%,$9,84,Michael Schachner,"Get after this one soon, for it seems to be fading. It's already quite gold in color, indicating maturity. What it lacks in vivacity, however, is made up for in the bright lemon, pineapple and melon flavors. It's a mixed bag of fruit, yet nothing really stands out."
Croix 2019 Eastside Ritchie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Croix,Red,Eastside Ritchie Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.6%,$78,91,Virginie Boone,"This bold, brawny wine is earthy with a wealth of forest and black tea. Tannic and concentrated in rich berry fruit, it is made in an unctuous, richly rewarding style from the famous site."
John Duval Wines 2015 Annexus Grenache (Barossa),John Duval Wines,Red,Annexus,Grenache,"Barossa, South Australia, Australia",14%,$60,92,Christina Pickard,"From ex-Penfolds winemaker John Duval and made in part from vines over 150 years old, this Grenache offers a complexity and depth. This favors dark fruit on the nose and is chock full of intriguing aromas of cumin, clove, chocolate, sandalwood and mint. The palate offers more of the same multifariousness, with added minerality reminiscent of hot stones and graphite. Drink now–2027."
Belvedere 2004 Healdsburg Ranches Chardonnay (Sonoma County),Belvedere,White,Healdsburg Ranches,Chardonnay,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",13.9%,$14,84,,"Okay everyday Chard, with toned-down peach, pear and oak flavors and a creaminess to the texture. Finishes dry, crisp and short."
Black Box 2017 Chardonnay (California),Black Box,White,,Chardonnay,"California, California Other, California, US",13.5%,$25,88,Jim Gordon,"This is a rich style of Chardonnay that shows pear and apple aromas, with vanilla and butter flavors. The palate offers a good balance of ripeness and natural acidity. It's medium in body and smoothly textured without feeling too soft."
Quinta do Regueiro 2018 Reserva Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),Quinta do Regueiro,White,Reserva,"Alvarinho, Albariño","Vinho Verde, Portugal",13.5%,$18,91,Roger Voss,"From the sub-region of Monção and Melgaço, this wine has perfumed fragrant fruitiness with hints of a creamy texture. It is rich and full in the mouth, touched by spice and pepper and likely to age for a while. It will be ready to drink from early 2020."
Château Kirwan 2009  Margaux,Château Kirwan,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",,$65,93,Roger Voss,"While it has weight and richness, this is also seriously structured, a wine packed with dry tannins. The potential is all there—the sweet fruit of the vintage along with a solid texture and final acidity."
Bryn Mawr Vineyards 2015 Tempranillo (Eola-Amity Hills),Bryn Mawr Vineyards,Red,,Tempranillo,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",15.3%,$50,87,Paul Gregutt,"This big-boned wine spent two years in barrel, 40% new. The ripe black fruits run all the way into cassis, with aromatics and flavor highlights that suggest wet hay. There's a heavy dose of vanilla, though the winery indicates that the barrels were French rather than American oak. At such high alcohol, this wine shows some back palate burn, and is best drunk soon."
Graziano 2014 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),Graziano,Red,,Zinfandel,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",15%,$19,92,Jim Gordon,"This is a snappy, well-balanced and also concentrated wine that's compelling to drink. Engaging complexity in the aromas leads to equally intriguing and spicy flavors that are well supported by good acidity and firm tannins."
Quinta do Portal NV 10 Year Old Aged White  (Port),Quinta do Portal,Port/Sherry,10 Year Old Aged White,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",19.5%,$25,88,Roger Voss,"This fruity style is also concentrated. Poised between the rich lemon and orange fruitiness and the touches of wood aging, the wine is balanced and medium sweet."
Troon 2003 Estate Reserve Zinfandel (Applegate Valley),Troon,Red,Estate Reserve,Zinfandel,"Applegate Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",,$60,84,Paul Gregutt,"The 2003 version of the estate Zinfandel clocks in at just 15.5% alcohol, but carries a fair amount of volatile nail polish aromas. It is marinated in new oak—French, American, Hungarian—so that whisky barrel scents and flavors cover up any taste of the varietal fruit."
Château de Braude 2016 Barrel Sample  (Haut-Médoc),Château de Braude,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Haut-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",,,87,Roger Voss,"86–88. Barrel Sample. This wine has an extracted character, leading to bitterness. Its fruit, buried under the tannins, could come through, although it is likely to always remain firm and structured."
Le Chiuse 2008  Rosso di Montalcino,Le Chiuse,Red,,"Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese","Rosso di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$30,87,,"Organically grown Sangiovese Grosso is the base of this bright and buoyant Rosso di Montalcino. There are mineral and campfire notes that play a supporting role to black cherry, currant and cola. The mouthfeel is compact and informal."
Trust 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Trust,Red,,,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$28,90,Paul Gregutt,"Though quite dark, spicy, smoky, fragrant and seductive, this is a very flavorful wine. Citrusy acids underscore flavors of grapefruit and orange, but the core of the wine is straightforward, pure and ripe berry. It's nice not to fight the fruit with oak; the aromatics are beautiful."
Minassian-Young 2016 Rosé of Cinsault (Paso Robles),Minassian-Young,Rose,Rosé of,"Cinsault, Other Red","Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",12.8%,$19,86,Matt Kettmann,"It's rare to find a straight Cinsault bottling, which is reason enough to seek this out. But the flavors are muted compared to other rosés. It leads with burnt orange, peach and pineapple aromas, and then delivers faint tropical flavors on the palate, reminiscent of papaya and coconut, lacking acidic zing."
Adair Bachman 2014 Rose & Thistle Rosé (Napa Valley),Adair Bachman,Rose,Rose & Thistle,Rosé,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.1%,$35,90,Virginie Boone,"This is made from 92% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Pinot Noir, an interesting and fulfilling combination thats robust on the palate. Pinkish-orange in color, it's both tangy and weighty, finishing dry in orange zest."
Antiquum Farm 2015 Aurosa Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Antiquum Farm,Rose,Aurosa,,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13%,$28,91,Paul Gregutt,"This unusual rosé is all Pinot Gris, picked for thick skins, chewy tannins, high acidity, and given a 36-hour cold soak prior to fermentation. It's a pale salmon/copper shade, full-bodied and juicy, with fruit flavors of peach and citrus. Highlights of hibiscus tea and floral aromatics contribute further complexity."
Wolf Blass 2005 Gold Label Riesling (Adelaide),Wolf Blass,White,Gold Label,Riesling,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",12%,$14,86,Joe Czerwinski,"Pretty straightforward stuff, with green apple and citrus aromas and just hints of honey and petrol. It's medium-bodied, with a touch of residual sugar, but ends with mouthwatering acids. Drink now–2010."
William Gunn 2019 Chardonnay (El Dorado),William Gunn,White,,Chardonnay,"El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",13.5%,$16,86,Jim Gordon,"This smooth and rich-textured wine offers a creamy mouthfeel, light apple and Bosc pear flavors and a noticeable streak of earth, almond and flint."
Henri Bourgeois 2014 Les Baronnes  (Sancerre),Henri Bourgeois,White,Les Baronnes,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sancerre, Loire Valley, France",12.5%,$23,88,Roger Voss,"An intense, mineral-driven wine, this is tight and very textured. Its dryness is mitigated by hints of riper mango and apricot that fill out the palate. The structure and the tense acidity show this wine is still young. Drink from 2017."
Rijk's 2018 Cape Winemakers Guild CWG Chenin Blanc (Tulbagh),Rijk's,White,Cape Winemakers Guild CWG,Chenin Blanc,"Tulbagh, South Africa",14%,,94,Lauren Buzzeo,"Winemaker: Pierre Wahl. This is quite toasty and oaky upfront right now, with pronounced aromas of wood-grilled apple, orange oil, custard and yellow melon. The palate is full and weighty, but not fat, with plush, mouth-filling toasted-fruit flavors that have a decadent, grilled edge and lingering impressions of sweet spice and toast on the finish. Impressions of yellow apple, musk melon, sweet braised fennel, straw and pie crust carry through on the close, with a kiss of honey on the way back as well as the lingering warmth of toasty baking-spice characteristics."
Valdipiatta 2013  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Valdipiatta,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$30,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Forest floor, truffle, new leather and woodland berry scents mingle in the glass. The palate is linear, taut and austere, offering sour cherry, licorice and sage notes, framed by firm acidity and assertive, close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink after 2019."
Guardian 2008 Angel Sauvignon Blanc (Red Mountain),Guardian,White,Angel,Sauvignon Blanc,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$20,89,Paul Gregutt,"This barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc is from Klipsun vineyard. There is a clean and lightly grassy nose, with added highlights of citrus, lime rind, lemon drop, honeysuckle and light toast."
Simi 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Simi,White,Reserve,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$35,88,,"A flinty wine, with toasty oak nuances.  Bright acidity supports a core of citrus and pear flavors that finish quite clean."
Brick House 2011 Les Dijonnais Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),Brick House,Red,Les Dijonnais,Pinot Noir,"Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13%,$52,93,Paul Gregutt,"Certified organic and Biodynamic, this estate-grown gem offers seductive scents of rose petals and orange blossoms, dried figs and a hint of pastry. The lush aromatics lead into a delicate yet profound wine, with a core of raspberry/cherry fruit, and lingering minerality."
Marc Kreydenweiss 2004 Perrières Red (Costières de Nîmes),Marc Kreydenweiss,Red,Perrières,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Costières de Nîmes, Rhône Valley, France",12.5%,$13,87,Roger Voss,"Alsatian Marc Kreydenweiss has acquired a vineyard in the Rhône Valley, where he practices the same biodynamic techniques as in Alsace. This lively, vividly fruity wine is full of red currant, fresh plum and lightly juicy fruit. Tannins lend some dryness to the aftertaste."
K Vintners 2007 Pheasant Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),K Vintners,Red,Pheasant Vineyard,,"Wahluke Slope, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$35,90,Paul Gregutt,"This is also a Milbrandt vineyard, but quite different flavors emerge from the other Milbrandt wines. Plenty of black cherry fruit, with a minerality that suggests iron ore. Penetrating, ripe and potent (15% alcohol), yet well balanced and complex, with wild herbs lurking in the background."
William Fèvre 2008 Valmur Grand Cru  (Chablis),William Fèvre,White,Valmur Grand Cru,Chardonnay,"Chablis, Burgundy, France",12.5%,$83,96,Roger Voss,"A great waft of ripe fruits, wood spice and tense acidity. A Valmur is a model for great Chablis, a taut wine, like a spring of green fruits waiting to burst out. This impressive wine needs aging, give it at least five years."
Château Latour-Martillac 2011 Barrel Sample  (Pessac-Léognan),Château Latour-Martillac,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,,89,Roger Voss,"88-90. Barrel sample. Firmly tannic on the initial taste, this wine shows bell pepper and juicy black-fruit flavors. It is light and fruity, and finishes with dry tannins."
Cambridge California 2013 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),Cambridge California,White,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$20,83,Virginie Boone,"Thick and sour, this wine has a waxy fruit component to it that is off-putting and out of sync with the crisp fruit that is trying to compete on the palate."
Plantagenet 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Great Southern),Plantagenet,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Great Southern, Western Australia, Australia",14%,$29,92,Joe Czerwinski,"Great Southern is an underrated source for Cabernet Sauvignon, amply demonstrated by this wine. Expansive notes of cedar, brown sugar, vanilla and baking spices enrobe tart berries, while the wine's firm structure carries through to a crisp, tannic finish. Try in 2020."
Gallo of Sonoma 1997 Sangiovese (Sonoma County),Gallo of Sonoma,Red,,Sangiovese,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",,$11,87,,"A bright, soft, user-friendly wine in the Gallo style. Delicate and pretty. Few complexities, but it's supple, balanced and very drinkable. Best Buy."

The ruby-colored wine is zippy and fresh with soft tannins and medium length in the mouth."
Brooks Note 2017 Pinot Blanc (Mendocino County),Brooks Note,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",13.3%,$24,89,Jim Gordon,"This crisp and appetizing wine offers herb and apricot aromas, lip-smacking acidity and tempting flavors of dried herbs, apricots and mineral water. It is medium bodied, shows no signs of oak and will be very versatile with food."
Ventosa 2010 Riesling (Finger Lakes),Ventosa,White,,Riesling,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12.5%,$17,86,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Scents of smoke and sweet roasted chestnuts add a warm, rustic tone to this medium-dry Riesling. Deeply concentrated, with ripe yellow peach and apricot flavors, it's brightened by a shower of lemonade acidity and a snappy lemon-rind finish."
Krug NV Grande Cuvée Brut  (Champagne),Krug,Sparkling,Grande Cuvée Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$150,91,Joe Czerwinski,"On the nose, dried apples and yeast notes are drenched in the rich aromas of clarified butter and malt; in the mouth, expect tons of mousse and a full mouthfeel, plus concentrated, dry fruit flavors (especially pear).  Finishes long, with smoldering toast and vanilla flavors.  ""Very solid stuff,"" wrote one taster.  Worthy of a very special occasion."
Von Strasser 2007 Grüner Veltliner (Diamond Mountain District),Von Strasser,White,,Grüner Veltliner,"Diamond Mountain District, Napa, California, US",12.5%,$40,87,,"This unoaked wine, made from the red-hot Austrian variety, is very dry and high in acidity. It has a grassy, gooseberry tang reminiscent of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, with some richer, chewier notes of figs and green apples. There's a spritziness that may calm down over the coming months."
W. Gisselbrecht 2016 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),W. Gisselbrecht,White,Tradition,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$17,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Very ripe pear notes on the nose have an earthy tinge and a hint of bruised apple. The palate reverts to ample, ripe pear notes that brim with easy, juicy flair, boosted by a hint of residual sweetness. It's an easy, just off-dry wine with attractive balance."
Meander 2005 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Meander,Red,Morisoli Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rutherford, Napa, California, US",,$100,95,,"Outstanding. Ultra-ripe and lush, but very dry, showing powerful, long hangtime flavors of black and red sour cherries, currants, violets and cedar, wrapped into dense, melted tannins. Almost Porty, but stops short of overripeness to finish with dramatic richness. The vineyard is adjacent to Rubicon's, in the heart of the Rutherford bench."
Nastl 2017 Langenlois Riesling (Kamptal),Nastl,White,Langenlois,Riesling,"Kamptal, Austria",13%,$22,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A tropical whiff of mango plays about the smoky reduction on the nose. The palate carries on in fruity abundance with that same mango and passion fruit combo and a bright note of lemony ripeness. The body is concentrated and zesty, and the finish is mouthwatering, dry and still wholly tropical."
Jean Loron 2018 Rift 69  (Beaujolais-Villages),Jean Loron,Red,Rift 69,Gamay,"Beaujolais-Villages, Beaujolais, France",13%,$17,88,Roger Voss,"One of the wave of Beaujolais wines bottled without added sulfur, this wine is all about black fruits and good acidity.

On the elegant spectrum of the variety, the wine is fairly subtle, with an evolving cinnamon spiciness to the finish."
Gryphon Crest 2017 Dry Riesling (Rheinhessen),Gryphon Crest,White,Dry,Riesling,"Rheinhessen, Germany",12%,$14,89,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Brisk tangs of lime and pineapple lend zest to this light-footed dry Riesling.

Cave de Turckheim 2016 Réserve Muscat (Alsace),Cave de Turckheim,White,Réserve,Muscat,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12%,$30,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Fresh, ripe notes of Meyer lemon are joined by hints of rose.

Bellarina 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,Bellarina,Red,,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$36,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"This has toasted oak, espresso and mature dark-skinned berry aromas. The palate dense and packed with prune, blackberry extract and roasted coffee flavors. Raspy tannins leave an abrupt, astringent finish."
Château Moncontour 2017 Demi-Sec  (Vouvray),Château Moncontour,White,Demi-Sec,Chenin Blanc,"Vouvray, Loire Valley, France",11.5%,$18,87,Roger Voss,"From vineyards above the grand chateau of Moncontour close to the Loire, this medium-dry wine offers acidity and crisp white fruits. Its freshness is as important as the perfumed fruitiness, giving the wine the potential to age. Drink from 2020."
Abacela 2001 Merlot (Oregon),Abacela,Red,,Merlot,"Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",,$18,89,Paul Gregutt,"Abacela has made great strides with its Merlots, and here the fruit has ripened past the “green” stage while retaining plenty of tannic, earthy mineral flavors. Dense and minerally, this has a core of sweet fruit and a pretty finish."
The Big Five Collection 2004 Rhino Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),The Big Five Collection,White,Rhino,Sauvignon Blanc,"Western Cape, South Africa",12%,$10,85,,"Opens with a soft mineral-herb bouquet. The rounder style continues on the palate, but ample citrus and white pepper notes keep it from being flaccid or mushy. Closes fairly long with a nice reprise of the early mineral notes. An appealing, well-done mainstream white."
Domaine Jacques Prieur 2014 Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Domaine Jacques Prieur,Red,Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Gevrey-Chambertin, Burgundy, France",13%,$103,92,Roger Voss,"This is produced from 25-year-old vines in the Chambertin Grand Cru vineyard. It is a smoky, structured wine with layers of dark fruits and ripe tannins, with the fresh acidity of the year. Lots of attractive fruit is surrounded by the firm tannins and dry aftertaste. It should not be drunk before 2020."
Lauren Ashton Cellars 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Lauren Ashton Cellars,White,,Chardonnay,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.1%,$25,91,Paul Gregutt,"Leesy and nicely textured, this has lime and green apple notes that rest on a bed of bracing acidity. It has length, focus and detail, all without intrusive new oak—just a small percentage of the wine was barrel-fermented."
The Snitch 2017 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),The Snitch,White,,Chardonnay,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$35,86,Virginie Boone,"Blended with 3% Viognier, the Snitch is within the Prisoner Wine Company portfolio of illustrative, creative label design.

Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Muscadelle (Rutherglen),Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,Fortified,,"Muscadelle, Muscat","Rutherglen, Victoria, Australia",18%,$16,90,Christina Pickard,"A luscious, amber-hued sticky from the spiritual home of dessert wines down under, Rutherglen, this wine oozes chocolate, caramel, mint, coffee and that old library smell that emanates from so many fortifieds. The palate is ultrarich and satin-textured with molassesy sweetness. The alcohol feels a little hot and it could use a bit more acidity, but this is nevertheless an affordable and indulgent drop."
Sobon Estate 2013 Cougar Hill Zinfandel (Amador County),Sobon Estate,Red,Cougar Hill,Zinfandel,"Amador County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.5%,$18,89,Jim Gordon,"Smoothness and richness describe this full-bodied wine.

The black currant fruit is balanced with acidity and a dense, tarry character. The wine exudes dark power, very firm and certainly ageworthy."

Note the relatively low alcohol, making this a perfect summer sipping wine."
Annefield Vineyards 2009 Cabernet Franc (Virginia),Annefield Vineyards,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"Virginia, Virginia, US",13.3%,$29,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This Virginia Cab Franc starts soft and ripe with loads of juicy black currant and berry flavors flecked with sweet, warm baking spices and cedar notes. A zesty kick of acidity on the midpalate and a flash of fresh, green herbs on the finish add elegance and balance."

The palate also offers the black fruit with a touch of purple flowers, but it is somewhat simple and weak, especially compared to this winery's other bottlings."
Januik 2006 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Januik,White,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$30,91,Paul Gregutt,"More new oak shows here; it's packed with butterscotch and toasted, caramel-coated, apple-flavored fruit. It's tighter, spicier and oakier than the Elerding Vineyard Chardonnay from Januik, though at the moment it seems less complex in the finish."

Leo 2005 X-treme Prestive Cuvée Red (Pfalz),Leo,Red,X-treme Prestive Cuvée,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Pfalz, Germany",14%,$42,85,Joe Czerwinski,"Extreme reflects a level of oaking that may prove controversial. Raw cedary notes mark the nose, while some dark fruit sneaks through on the palate, reflecting the blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. More wood shows up again on the finish, partially balanced by tart berries."
J. Lohr 2000 PAU Red (Paso Robles),J. Lohr,Red,PAU,"Cabernet Blend, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",,$50,82,,"I don't know if there's technical residual sugar in this wine, but it sure tastes like it.

Quinta do Crasto 2006 Touriga Nacional (Douro),Quinta do Crasto,Red,,"Touriga Nacional, Portuguese Red","Douro, Portugal",14.5%,$100,93,Roger Voss,"The initial wood flavors dominate this still-young wine. With its tight mineral character and black currant fruits, it is very focused despite its power and intensity. The flavors open slowly over many hours, emphasizing the need for 4–5 years' aging."
Patel 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Patel,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.1%,$60,88,Virginie Boone,"Herbal and earthy, this white tastes of pea shoots, peach and flowers.

Hobo 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Hobo,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13%,$20,90,,"This is not an ageable Cab, but it is balanced and complex, and has more than $20 worth of elegance. Dry and softly tannic, the Provençal herb, black cherry and oak flavors make you reach for a second glass."
Rütz 2017 Maison Grand Cru Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Rütz,White,Maison Grand Cru,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$35,85,Virginie Boone,"This wine is tart and cloudy, with strong flavors of baked pineapple and anise.

It's crafted from 70% Viognier and 30% Roussanne."
Quinta de Chocapalha 2008 Tinto Red (Lisboa),Quinta de Chocapalha,Red,Tinto,Portuguese Red,"Lisboa, Portugal",13.5%,,91,Roger Voss,"This wine feels big and burly, its tannins powering through the fruit. It has a strong structure, firm black plums, the acidity giving a lift to the weight of dark fruits. It needs aging, over the next 4–5 years."
Molnar Family 2007 Poseidon's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros-Napa Valley),Molnar Family,Red,Poseidon's Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Carneros-Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.1%,$30,91,,"A bit more concentrated than the '06, but similar in lush, appealing flavors of cherries, raspberries, cedar, cola, vanilla and spices. With a silky texture, it should develop through 2013."

Silverado 2005 Miller Ranch Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Silverado,White,Miller Ranch Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.9%,$18,88,,"This wine is so high-toned in wildflowers you might think it was Alsatian, maybe Pinot Gris, a suspicion the high acidity also supports. But it's Sauvignon Blanc, with a rich core of yellow citrus fruit and papaya and an elegant minerality. This is a classy white wine at a good price."
Lucien Crochet 2018  Sancerre,Lucien Crochet,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sancerre, Loire Valley, France",14%,$32,92,Roger Voss,"Based in the village of Bué, this producer is a top name.

One example is the sour note on the finish that distracts from the wine's pleasant flavors of stone fruit, melon and cut grass."
Fitz-Ritter 2008 Spätlese Gewürztraminer (Pfalz),Fitz-Ritter,White,Spätlese,Gewürztraminer,"Pfalz, Germany",10%,$22,89,,"Mid-gold in color, this has a pronounced classic Gewürztraminer nose of lychee, rose petals, spice and ripe stone fruit with notes of earthy minerality.

Sullivan,"Cocoa, vanilla and baking spice aromas intertwine with cranberry, black licorice, herb and dark fruit on a wine with a very distinctive aromatic profile.

It's got an unusual structure, and dramatically displays this biodynamic vineyard's funky, herbal, earthy character, with plenty of acidity from the Tempranillo, and a little bit of the tomato leaf character also. A complex, unique, distinctive wine that does not show fruit so much as earth and terroir. It keeps going, adding weight and depth through the midpalate, with a strong tomato component."
Baer 2012 Arctos Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Baer,Red,Arctos,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$43,93,Sean P. Sullivan,"Cabernet Sauvignon (65%) takes the lead on this wine followed by Merlot (15%) and equal parts Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Aromas of high-toned dried herbs, flowers, black currant, coffee and barrel spices lead to densely packed black fruit flavors that need time to strut their stuff. Drink after 2021."
Husch 2018 Chenin Blanc (Mendocino),Husch,White,,Chenin Blanc,"Mendocino, Mendocino County, California, US",13.3%,$13,87,Jim Gordon,"Medium bodied and just a touch sweet, this wine overflows with ripe apple and melon aromas, and broad rich appley and floral flavors."
Philippe Fontaine NV Réserve Brut  (Champagne),Philippe Fontaine,Sparkling,Réserve Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$54,88,Roger Voss,"This is a crisp, dry wine that exibits delicious acidity, along with fresh citrus and green-apple flavors.

Rivetto 2015 Marcarini  (Barbaresco),Rivetto,Red,Marcarini,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$41,92,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of truffle, smoke, leather and wild berry take center stage. Boasting an earthy elegance, the medium-bodied palate offers dried cherry, cranberry, star anise and a hint of game set against grainy tannins that leave a firm drying finish. It's still rather austere and needs a few more years to unwind. Drink 2021–2027."
Sevtap 2017 Autumn Claret (Santa Ynez Valley),Sevtap,Red,Autumn,"Claret, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",12.7%,$38,90,Matt Kettmann,"Cherry and berry aromas are lifted by cola, incense and Dr Pepper elements on the nose of this blend of 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 19% Petit Verdot.

Sullivan,"The aromas start out reticent for the variety, with pear, white peach and green apple notes. The palate is sleek but flavorful, with pleasant balance. It lacks only a bit more expression; perhaps additional time in bottle will bring it out."

Mollydooker 2014 Velvet Glove Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Mollydooker,Red,Velvet Glove,,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",16.5%,$185,93,Joe Czerwinski,"Full-bodied, rich and chewy, this is a big, bold wine. Ample oak frames black cherry and cassis fruit, adding hints of vanilla and dark chocolate to the fudge-like impression. Warmth suffuses the palate, but doesn't quite progress to full-blown high-alcohol heat. There's no doubting its impressive intensity and ripeness. Drink now–2025."

Finishes chalky."

Volker Eisele Family Estate 2007 Gemini White (Napa Valley),Volker Eisele Family Estate,White,Gemini,White Blend,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.5%,$25,93,,"A mighty fine white wine. Fills the much-needed niche of extreme dryness, acidity and restraint, which are the hallmarks of elegance. Call it the anti-Chardonnay. A Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend with some barrel and sur lie influence, it's rich and crisp in Meyer lemon, pear, fig, vanilla and smoky butter flavors."
La Folia Winery 2013 The Madness Red (Sierra Foothills),La Folia Winery,Red,The Madness,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Sierra Foothills, Sierra Foothills, California, US",15.1%,$50,91,Jim Gordon,"Abundant dark-fruit flavors and a smooth mouth-coating texture make a good combo in this deep-colored, full-bodied but not overly tannic wine.

Sassy Bitch 2008 Chardonnay (Central Valley),Sassy Bitch,White,,Chardonnay,"Central Valley, Chile",13.5%,$10,81,Michael Schachner,"Dull and cidery, with mealy apple aromas and similar flavors. Offers almost nothing besides a pale straw color, generic white fruit and corny side notes."

Foppiano 2002 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Foppiano,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$23,90,,"A dry, medium-bodied Pinot that shows very ripe fruit, easy tannins and a crisp bite of acidity.

Blackberry, cassis and natural peppery flavors fill out this cement-fermented-and-aged Malbec from the highest part of Tupungato. A steady, focused finish is clean and powerful, and overall this is a racy muscular wine to drink through 2024."
Thelema 2010 Sutherland Sauvignon Blanc (Elgin),Thelema,White,Sutherland,Sauvignon Blanc,"Elgin, South Africa",13.5%,$15,85,Lauren Buzzeo,"A bit muted and shy on the nose, with faint accents of fresh grass, sweet citrus and just-ripe gooseberry.

This is so fine, so clean, that it suggests a cool, Alpine stream. Zesty freshness conquers all—just a few peppery, yeasty notes are glimpsed at the edges. A racy memento of the 2014 vintage."
Hanna 2010 Bismark Mountain Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),Hanna,Red,Bismark Mountain Vineyard,Zinfandel,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma, California, US",16.2%,$53,86,,"This high altitude vineyard reliably produces enormously ripe fruit with correspondingly giant alcohol and tannin levels.

Veramonte 2000 Merlot (Maipo Valley),Veramonte,Red,,Merlot,"Maipo Valley, Chile",13.5%,$10,90,,"An interesting wine, with a rich tobacco and clove streak that's distinctive. There are underlying flavors of blackberries and chocolate, and the acidity is just right. It has depth and substance, which are rare at this price. Try pulling this one out and serving it to your wine snob neighbor, blind."
Château Saint Jacques 2015  Pomerol,Château Saint Jacques,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pomerol, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$50,92,Roger Voss,"Made from 80% Merlot, this wine is smooth and generously textured.

It is powered both by its tannins and by dark black fruits. This is solid, dark and powerful but still young needing plenty of time for the rich fruits to broaden out and mature. Drink starting from 2019."

Scents and flavors conjure up plum, candied orange peel and baking spices, guaranteed to tickle the taste buds. It's a little bumpy in the finish, perhaps as a result of the long ride south taken by the grapes. Drink now while it's at its best."
Naumes 2018 Syrah (Rogue Valley),Naumes,Red,,,"Rogue Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",14.5%,$35,89,Paul Gregutt,"Overall, Rogue Valley Syrahs get better every year, as the vineyards age and when vintage conditions allow for full ripening. This new release brings some green herb and savory flavors to tart fruit flavors of rhubarb and raspberry. There are gentle hints of the cured meat and umami flavors that the better Oregon Syrahs can reveal. This does not taste as ripe as in past vintages. The new oak (40%) barrel flavors are still prominent, with toasted cashew and hazelnut dominating the finish."

And that's just fine. It has a good core of blackberry and currant fruit, and the balance suggests some time in the cellar. Give it 3–4 years."

Heavy and wide on the palate, with a soft, chunky foundation, this blend of Tempranillo and Merlot tastes of raisin, vanilla, tobacco and cherry liqueur.

Ca'Na 2005 Celebration Rose Rosé (Contra Costa County),Ca'Na,Rose,Celebration Rose,Rosé,"Contra Costa County, Central Coast, California, US",13.9%,$14,85,,"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a full-bodied and rather rustic pink-hued wine, with earthy peach and spice flavors. If you tasted it blind, you might even think it was Chardonnay."
Cloudy Bay 2017 Chardonnay (Marlborough),Cloudy Bay,White,,Chardonnay,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13%,DrizlyVivino,89,Christina Pickard,"Cloudy's Bay's Chardonnay is a polished and ripe number that feels a touch sweaty on the nose, with ripe melon and stone fruit, honey, flint, florals and a lick of vanillin oak. The palate is thick and creamy but there's a citrusy lift on the midpalate that brightens things, and a wreath of spicy oak adding sophistication."
Corliss Estates 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Corliss Estates,Red,,,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.9%,$65,91,Sean P.

Iijima,"Tropical notes of guava and pineapple are struck by crushes of salt and smoke in this intensely fruity, juicy Riesling kabinett. Just a shade sweet and profoundly ripe in fruit, it's an opulent expression of the Mosel but maintains a zingy, steely edge and fine, filigreed finish. Ready now but should maintain peak through 2030 and hold further."
Wrath 2008 Noble Wrath Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),Wrath,Dessert,Noble Wrath Late Harvest,Sauvignon Blanc,"Monterey, Central Coast, California, US",13.3%,$33,87,,"A fantastically sweet wine, with very high residual sugar.

The palate offers a similar array of sweet dark fruit, but the tannic structure and acidity clean it up nicely."
Lomas del Valle 2016 Coastal Cool Climate Wine Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),Lomas del Valle,White,Coastal Cool Climate Wine Single Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,"Casablanca Valley, Chile",13.2%,$19,89,Michael Schachner,"Lime and green-apple aromas are tight and stony.

Billsboro 2015 Atwater Vineyards Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Billsboro,White,Atwater Vineyards,Chardonnay,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",13.1%,$13,87,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whiffs of savory spice and terra-cotta pots lend rusticity to this unusually earthy Chardonnay. Partial fermentation on grape skins gives the palate grip, accentuating softer tones of bruised apple and pear. Brisk acidity lengthens the finish."
José Maria da Fonseca 2017 Periquita Reserva Red (Península de Setúbal),José Maria da Fonseca,Red,Periquita Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Península de Setúbal, Portugal",90%,$17,90,Roger Voss,"It is a combination of fruit selection, a longer time in wood and the extra bottle aging that gives this wine its reserva label. With a dense texture and spice and richness from the wood and the juicy black fruits, the wine is developing well and will be ready from late 2020."
Carpineto 2010 Molin Vecchio Red (Toscana),Carpineto,Red,Molin Vecchio,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$68,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Syrah and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas evoking dark berry, underbrush and cedar.

Michelle,White,Cold Creek,Chardonnay,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,VivinoWine.com,90,Paul Gregutt,"Big, oaky and extremely bright, with refreshing acids and crisply defined fruit. As is usually the case with this spectacular vineyard, the flavors carry extra intensity; they seem to drill down into the heart of the palate. Though released young, this is a wine that could certainly benefit from another 6–12 months in the bottle."
Cono Sur 2009 Viognier (Colchagua Valley),Cono Sur,White,,Viognier,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",13.5%,$10,85,Michael Schachner,"Comes across like a straightforward warm-climate Viognier, meaning it's full and waxy, with peach and nectarine aromas and flavors, a touch of searing heat, and pithiness to the back palate and finish. It's also juicy and zesty due to plenty of acids."
McFadden 2020 Blue Quail Organic Grapes Estate Grown Pinot Gris (Potter Valley),McFadden,White,Blue Quail Organic Grapes Estate Grown,,"Potter Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",13.5%,$16,87,Jim Gordon,Light floral and apple aromas lead to crisp fruit flavors in this medium-bodied and refreshing wine.

Floral and earthy, with a note of clove and flint, it's tightly wound in grippy tannin and tart cranberry, cassis and raspberry, with a lasting trace of black tea."
Chumeia 2000 Pinot Blanc (Monterey County),Chumeia,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",,$14,84,,"Smells fragrant and inviting, with aromas of peach, vanilla, smoke and a pretty wildflower streak. In the mouth, the wine seems dominated by high acidity and lees, making it rather tart and sour despite the fruity flavors."
Casa Santos Lima 2014 Tarambola Red (Lisboa),Casa Santos Lima,Red,Tarambola,Portuguese Red,"Lisboa, Portugal",14%,$20,86,Roger Voss,"This is a ripe, perfumed wine, smooth from light oak aging and fruity with the black currant flavors.

Contrada Michele 2004 Hirpus  (Taurasi),Contrada Michele,Red,Hirpus,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Taurasi, Southern Italy, Italy",,,86,,"The wine opens with thick, purple concentration and segues to earthy aromas of asphalt, tar and mineral backed by dark fruit, prune and berry. It's a strange wine with too much emphasis on those heavy resin and tar notes but it would pair well with Mexican chocolate mole sauce."
The Gentleman's Match Wine Co 2015 Madame X Red (Napa Valley),The Gentleman's Match Wine Co,Red,Madame X,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$33,88,Virginie Boone,"Tight-grained tannins underscore high tones of plum, cherry and coconut shavings in this full-bodied red which blends a majority of Merlot with Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.

The low alcohol suggests it was picked early, and the flavors offer a subtle mix of blood orange, plum, blueberry and blackberry fruit. Though delicate, it's not lacking for depth or complexity, and shows medium concentration through a long finish."
Cypress 2003 Chardonnay (California),Cypress,White,,Chardonnay,"California, California Other, California, US",,$10,84,,"An easy, everyday Chard, with apricot and peach flavors and a little oak. Finishes creamy and dry."

Avila 2004 Merlot (Santa Barbara County),Avila,Red,,Merlot,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",,$13,82,,"An odd wine, at once raw and green, then turning semi-sweet. Too bad, because the tannins are really lush and smooth."

Raptor Ridge 2015 Reserva Tempranillo (Rogue Valley),Raptor Ridge,Red,Reserva,Tempranillo,"Rogue Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",13.9%,$40,87,Paul Gregutt,"Sourced from the Folin vineyard, this is quite light and herbal. The flavors move into a tannic midpalate, with tobacco and tea rather than ripe fruit. It spent almost two years in 100% new French oak, which seems to have sent the fruit packing, at least for the time being."

The palate is lighter on fruit yet heavy in structure, with the tannins giving a firm grip."
Naggiar 2016 Chardonnay (California),Naggiar,White,,Chardonnay,"California, California Other, California, US",14.2%,$24,89,Jim Gordon,"Citrus and light herb aromas turn to slightly more buttery, spicy flavors in this medium-bodied well-balanced wine.

The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, and the wine is fully dry. There's an edge of rough earthiness that keeps it from getting a higher score, but it's still a very good wine. —S.H."

Iijima,"Earthen tones of struck flint and smoke need time and aeration to allow prettier notes of grapefruit and honeysuckle to appear. A powerful, full-bodied dry Riesling, it penetrates with tart tangerine flavor and a zesty cutting mouthfeel. This tight mineral-dense Riesling needs time to meld. Hold till 2023."

Joullian 1999 Merlot (Carmel Valley),Joullian,Red,,Merlot,"Carmel Valley, Central Coast, California, US",,$30,89,,"Long on flavor, this is a classy wine meant for white tablecloths. The pleasant aromas are of green olives, smoke, white chocolate and berries, and a hint of bacon fat. Drinks soft and plush, striking a nice balance between herbs and fruit.

The palate is austere and linear, with the acidity and tightly wound, chalky tannins taking center stage. But the silky fruit is present too, along with a savory finish. Give this time in bottle and then sip with protein at hand. Drink now through 2027."

Savory spice notes streak across the plush, structured palate, giving way to a mocha finish. There's enough acidity and tannic structure to explore how this will develop in the years to come. Give it another year or two for the oak to integrate further."
Sonsierra 2016  Rioja,Sonsierra,Red,,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$16,85,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of road tar, blackberry and rubber are a touch chemical but not bad. A raw palate with rubbery tannins is home to generic plum and berry flavors. A dry rubbery-feeling finish is appropriate for this everyday Tempranillo."

Ottoventi 2018 Red (Sicilia),Ottoventi,Red,,,"Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",14%,$13,83,Kerin O’Keefe,"This simple red has a shy nose that eventually shows suggestions of iron, violet and menthol while the extremely evolved palate offers the merest suggestions of prune and rusty nail. Fleeting, dusty tannins give it an abrupt, astringent close."
Pavona 2001 Coastal Selection Pinot Noir (Monterey County),Pavona,Red,Coastal Selection,Pinot Noir,"Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",,$20,85,,"Delicate all around in body, texture and flavor.

Hartford 2007 Seascape Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Hartford,Red,Seascape,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$65,95,,"The Jackson and Hartford families established this vineyard on the far Sonoma Coast in hopes of crafting Pinot Noir at the limits of its ability to ripen. The magnificent 2007 vintage has resulted in a wine of unusual tension. It's very ripe in black and red cherry pie filling and sweet oak flavors, but retains the acidity of its cool-climate origins, and even offers a feral taste of bloody meat. Drink this impressive, complex wine now and through 2015."
Domaine Pierre Luneau-Papin 2007 Clos des Allées Vieilles Vignes  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),Domaine Pierre Luneau-Papin,White,Clos des Allées Vieilles Vignes,"Melon, Other White","Muscadet Sèvre et Maine, Loire Valley, France",12%,$24,89,Roger Voss,"Super-fresh, this is tight, full of green fruit and crisp apple flavors.

Iijima,"Luxurious guava, grapefruit and red berry aromas perfum this intensely fruity, sun-kissed spätlese. It's wispy and spry on the palate but penetrating acidity guides a long brambly finish.

Iijima,"Luminous blackberry and raspberry flavors are edged by shards of stone and smoke in this deeply fruity but intensely mineral Syrah. It's fresher and brighter in fruit than the producer's other 2016 Hermitage, full bodied but taut and bracing in feel. Rigid tannins should meld as the wine opens and gains complexity. Best enjoyed from 2022, it should reward cellaring well through 2040."
Marco Abella 2015 Roca Grisa Single Vineyard Carignan (Priorat),Marco Abella,Red,Roca Grisa Single Vineyard,Carignan,"Priorat, Catalonia, Spain",14.5%,,92,Michael Schachner,"A warm vintage resulted in a ripe varietal Carignan that offers black fruit, raisin and vanilla aromas. A fleshy, pulpy palate is in balance but hefty, while this tastes of ripe black fruits, prune and cassis. A steady and deep finish offers a blueberry essence and long echoes of ripeness. Drink through 2026."

Iijima,"Pristine grapefruit, yellow peach and fresh apricot flavors abound in this honeyed, intensely fruity Riesling. It's sweet on the palate but balanced by spine tingling acidity and a touch of saffron on the finish. An excellent value Auslese to enjoy now–2025."
Papapietro Perry 2003 Leras Family Vineyards Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Papapietro Perry,Red,Leras Family Vineyards,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$45,86,,"There's good acidity in this wine, with fruit that seems too extracted and sweet, like a baked, granulated sugar-infused cherry pie. If you're a fruit freak, this will do it for you."
Onesta 2013 Bokisch Vineyard Viognier (Lodi),Onesta,White,Bokisch Vineyard,Viognier,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",13.5%,$22,88,Jim Gordon,"This crisp, tangy and refreshing wine has lemon and green-apple aromas, bright citrus flavors, medium body and a lean texture, due mostly to the generous acidity.

The wine's ripe tannins give density while bringing out red fruits and a fresh edge. Sourced from two parcels, the wine will be ready from 2023."
SeaGlass 2019 Rosé (Monterey County),SeaGlass,Rose,,Rosé,"Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",13%,$12,89,Matt Kettmann,"A brilliant shade of pink, this bottling offers plenty of melon, rose and chalk aromas on the nose. The palate grabs hold with just enough texture, leading into lemon and cantaloupe flavors."

Yangarra 2017 PF Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Yangarra,Red,PF,,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",13%,DrizlyVivino,91,Christina Pickard,"This is Yangarra's foray into this very Australian preservative-free category of wines, and the result is delicious. Brambly fruit, baking spices, coffee, vanilla and ground peppercorn aromas lead to a palate that is plush but firm, deftly woven with stony, mineral tannins, an earthy core and a long savory, herbal finish. This is a clean-cut, warming wine that makes you want to eat a gamy casserole on a cold day in winter."

Rippon 2003 Pinot Noir (Central Otago),Rippon,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Central Otago, New Zealand",,$25,87,Joe Czerwinski,"Spicy, mushroomy and earthy, full of forest floor character, what the French would call sous bois. It's nicely textured as well, supple and round, just don't expect a fruit explosion. Imported by Station Imports Inc."
Domaine Jacques Prieur 2001 Clos de la Feguine Premier Cru  (Beaune),Domaine Jacques Prieur,White,Clos de la Feguine Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Beaune, Burgundy, France",14%,$61,88,Joe Czerwinski,"The aromas aren't too different from what you might find in a New World Chardonnay: toast, butter, cinnamon and apples, but the mouthfeel is hard and unyielding, and there's a firm spine of lemony acidity. Needs some time; try from 2005–2010."
Domaine des Remizières 2000 Cuvée Emilie White (Hermitage),Domaine des Remizières,White,Cuvée Emilie,Rhône-style White Blend,"Hermitage, Rhône Valley, France",,,89,Roger Voss,"A wine that is dominated by ripe exotic fruits, plums and a hint of green figs.

The palate is a little more fruity than the nose, but still it's dry and tight, with raspberry and cherry flavors. While some acidity sits on the surface, overall this gran reserva is tasty, fresh and more than likable. Drink now through 2013."
Elk Cove 2016 Estate Riesling (Willamette Valley),Elk Cove,White,Estate,Riesling,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13%,$19,92,Paul Gregutt,"Most of the estate vines used for this blend date back to the mid-1970s. It emphasizes bright citrus flavors, like lemon and lime, with lemon verbena, cilantro and other fresh herb notes that add detail to the finish. A very fine value, it can also age for a decade or longer."

At first, it's almost odorless, but give it a chance to develop in the glass and delicate apple, fern and lime notes emerge. A hint of CO2 adds to the impression of lightness, and the wine finishes crisp, racy and clean. A finesse-filled wine likely best in its youth."

Turning Leaf NV Chardonnay (California),Turning Leaf,White,,Chardonnay,"California, California Other, California, US",12.5%,DrizlyVivinoGary's Wine,84,,"This Chard is bit thin and soft, with straightforward fruit-cocktail flavors.

A minor quibble is the taste of raisins, the result of overripeness in the grapes."
Château Nenin 2008 Fugue de Nenin  (Pomerol),Château Nenin,Red,Fugue de Nenin,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pomerol, Bordeaux, France",,,89,Roger Voss,"Smoke, chocolate, toffee, spice and caramel. It's ripe, very open, full-bodied, with a rich Merlot character."

Carrick 2006 Pinot Noir (Central Otago),Carrick,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Central Otago, New Zealand",14%,$43,89,Joe Czerwinski,"This is a big, slightly rustic Pinot that marches to a decidedly unfruity beat.

Iijima,"Pretty blossom, guava and pink grapefruit notes abound in this gorgeously perfumed, dry Riesling. It's lively and fresh, but maintains a creamy lusciousness on the palate. Concentrated and zingy, it lingers through a long finish marked by murmurs of astringency. Drinks beautifully already but should improve through 2030 and hold further."
Von Siebenthal 2010 Tatay de Cristóbal Carmenère (Aconcagua Valley),Von Siebenthal,Red,Tatay de Cristóbal,Carmenère,"Aconcagua Valley, Chile",14.5%,$200,88,Michael Schachner,"Forgetting about the crazy price, this is a rustic wine with graphite, green herb, tobacco and marzipan aromas. The mouthfeel is hard and resiny, while flavors of blue fruits, graphite and oak finish green, candied and sweet. Overall, this is a particular wine that requires patience and digging."
Cordella 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,Cordella,Red,,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$85,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Tilled soil, forest floor, mature black-skinned fruit, leather and a truffle note come together in the glass.

The palate shows potent acidity and bracing tannins, while the flavors are dark and feature a fair share of vanilla, butter and creamy accents. Cola and cassis cover the finish. Drinkable now but better from late 2010 through 2012."
Collelceto 2013 Elia Palazzesi  (Brunello di Montalcino),Collelceto,Red,Elia Palazzesi,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$55,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with aromas of dark berry, underbrush and chewing tobacco.

It is well structured and concentrated, a benefit from using fruit sourced from low-yield old vines. With its dark, dense texture, it will age for several years."

Chianti Trambusti 1998 Celsus  (Sangiovese di Toscana),Chianti Trambusti,Red,Celsus,Sangiovese,"Sangiovese di Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13%,$22,84,Michael Schachner,"This wine from the Trambusti company features a nose of pepper, leather and mint. The palate runs sharp, with berry fruit, black pepper and some pronounced bell pepper. Ripeness is in doubt here; the back end is extremely green and peppery, and just doesn't have the fruit flavors of a well-ripened Sangiovese. But structure seems right."
Evergreen Vineyards 2008 Spruce Goose Riesling (Willamette Valley),Evergreen Vineyards,White,Spruce Goose,Riesling,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$20,88,Paul Gregutt,"Laurent Montalieu is the winemaker behind the Spruce Goose wines.

Avila 2000 Merlot (Santa Barbara County),Avila,Red,,Merlot,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$12,89,,"An interesting wine that belies its price. Rich blackberry flavors ride side-by-side with earthy, herbal notes of dark coffee and tobacco. A good percentage of new French oak shows up, especially in the vanilla and toast accents of the aroma. This full-bodied, bone-dry wine has a lot of richness."
Alma Rosa 2004 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Alma Rosa,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14%,$32,87,,"Here's a heavy, dense, slightly sweet Pinot that may not be at its best now. It's young and jammy, in the way of a wine that hasn't had time to settle down. But the fruit is huge, and the tannins and acids are all there. Cellar until at least 2007."
Gainey 2005 Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),Gainey,White,Limited Selection,Sauvignon Blanc,"Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.9%,$20,93,,"Another beautiful wine from Gainey, a great producer whose Sauvignon Blanc comes from one of the best terroirs for that variety in California. The aroma is so invitingly rich in lemongrass, pineapple zest, Key lime pie and coconut macaroon that you almost fear it won't follow up in the mouth, but it does. Bone dry, rich, zesty and clean, it seems to have benefited from the coolness of the vintage, in the way the beautifully ripe fruit is accented by crisp, flinty acidity. This is gorgeous, world-class Sauvignon Blanc."

Ayoub 2013 Mojo Red (America),Ayoub,Red,Mojo,"Red Blends, Red Blends","America, US",13.5%,$75,89,Paul Gregutt,"A 50-50 California Cab Franc-Oregon Pinot Noir blend, this works better than most attempts to blend Pinot Noir with anything. It's aromatically focused, scented with exotic incense that's soft, sultry and smooth. The fruit suggests cherry and plum, with streaks of stem, leaf and rather stiff tannins. It's the barrel flavors that help to pull it all together."
Le Mas de l'Ecriture 2005 Emotion Occitane Red (Coteaux du Languedoc),Le Mas de l'Ecriture,Red,Emotion Occitane,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Coteaux du Languedoc, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",13%,$20,88,Lauren Buzzeo,"Enjoyable and approachable now with straightforward red cherry, berry and game notes spiced up by glimmers of mocha and nutmeg.

Viña Pérez Cruz 2005 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Viña Pérez Cruz,Red,Reserva,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Maipo Valley, Chile",14.5%,$11,88,Michael Schachner,"Here's a full-force Maipo red that's ready to run. The black cherry aromas and flavors are dark and chocolaty, while the feel is solid and the finish long and minty warm. Big but not plush; loaded but not opulent. A commendable large-production wine (45,000 cases)."
Salentein 2019 Portillo Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Uco Valley),Salentein,Red,Portillo Estate Bottled,Pinot Noir,"Uco Valley, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$11,86,Michael Schachner,"Dusty red plum and currant aromas are easy to peg as Pinot Noir.

Domaine Chantepierre 2019  Tavel,Domaine Chantepierre,Rose,,Rosé,"Tavel, Rhône Valley, France",14.5%,$22,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Heady aromas of blackberry, dried cherries and anise extend from nose to finish in this intensely pink wine. A blend of both red grapes (Grenache, Cinsault and Syrah) and white grapes (Clairette and Picpoul) fermented together, it's a juicy, intensely berry-flavored wine peppered by spice and dried herb notes.

It's quite flat on the sip, with sour orange, strawberry and plum notes, and that makes it seem more like an afterthought than a focused rosé, which is such a competitive category now."
Ca' del Bosco 1994 Cuvée Annamaria Clementi  (Franciacorta),Ca' del Bosco,Sparkling,Cuvée Annamaria Clementi,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Franciacorta, Lombardy, Italy",12.5%,$120,91,Joe Czerwinski,"Very fine wine, showing all of the complexity you expect from a great sparkler combined with delicacy and elegance.

Nyetimber NV Demi-Sec Sparkling (England),Nyetimber,Sparkling,Demi-Sec,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling",,12%,$67,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The mellowness of ripe yellow apples is apparent immediately, as is the creamy yeasty depth of autolysis. The palate brims with notes of wet chalk and baked apple and a combination of freshness and richness that is compelling. This is a demi-sec and with its subtle sweet-sour balance, this finds its place with fruity desserts, cheese and Asian, hot spice. These flavors will benefit most from this wine's inherent off-dry balance."
Château les Roques 2013  Loupiac,Château les Roques,Dessert,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Loupiac, Bordeaux, France",14.5%,,86,Roger Voss,"This wine ultrarich—perhaps too much so. With intense apricot and spice flavors, it's a dense powerhouse of bitter botrytis that lacks elegance. Although it will soften with time, the superripe character will remain."

Yet this is a compact and linear sparkler that is pulled tightly together by the mineral notes that define it. It ends on a fruity but acidic note."
Vagnoni 1997 Riserva  (Chianti Colli Senesi),Vagnoni,Red,Riserva,Sangiovese,"Chianti Colli Senesi, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$14,87,,"A slightly muted nose of dark cherry and toast offers hints of rose and tar. Similar flavors play on the palate with a touch of chocolate and a smooth mouthfeel. Long and dry, the espresso-tinged finish is elegant. The depth of fruit can be sensed and this should open up with short-term cellaring, displaying more depth and richness in a year's time."
The Seeker 2017 Malbec (Mendoza),The Seeker,Red,,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$14,83,Michael Schachner,"Band-Aid and black fruit aromas amount to a mild and innocuous nose. This feels collapsed, but it's not without a pulse. Spicy, herbal flavors of plum and berry are a bit green, while this is narrow and hollow on the finish."
Vigne & Vini 2001 Schiaccianoci Riserva Negroamaro (Salento),Vigne & Vini,Red,Schiaccianoci Riserva,"Negroamaro, Italian Red","Salento, Southern Italy, Italy",15%,$18,88,,"Vibrant fruit, red apple and blue flowers appear with intensity on the nose to create a racy, clean red wine. The acidity is good, as is the structure, but the 15% alcohol does hit the palate hard. Pair it with cream-based pasta (to counter the alcohol), white meat and roasted winter vegetables."
J. Portugal Ramos 2010 Loios Branco White (Alentejano),J. Portugal Ramos,White,Loios Branco,Portuguese White,"Alentejano, Portugal",12.5%,$10,85,Roger Voss,"Attractive, softly fruity wine, with some citrus character as well as pear and apple juice. It is crisp, fresh, ready to drink. Winebow."
Brotte 2019 Les Hauts de Barville Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),Brotte,Red,Les Hauts de Barville,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rhône Valley, France",15%,$47,93,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Deep, ruminating layers of black plum and cherry confiture are lifted by tangs of crushed salt and stone in this bright, fresh-fruited blend of Grenache and Syrah. It's mouthfilling and rich but maintains a thrilling zestiness, too. Fringed by fine-grained, lingering tannins, it's at peak now but should maintain vibrantly through 2027 at least."
Donelan 2016 Tripp's Block Perli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),Donelan,Red,Tripp's Block Perli Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Mendocino Ridge, Mendocino County, California, US",14.5%,$78,90,Virginie Boone,"Delicate and floral on the nose, this wine picks up intensity as it develops in the glass, coming from a 2,000-foot-elevation site surrounded by wilderness. Textured and layered in strawberry and rich cola, it has a woody finish of forest and oak."
La Crema 1999 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),La Crema,White,,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$30,90,,"This appealing Chardonnay is the same wine that carried a reserve designation in prior vintages. It's lushly woven and has aromas and flavors of pear, pineapple and peach. The fruit is rich but not overly sweet, and sports accents of cinnamon and allspice. This balanced, medium-weight wine finishes long and easy with a nice nuttiness. Top Value."
LaVelle 2008 Matthew's Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),LaVelle,Red,Matthew's Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$36,91,Paul Gregutt,"The winery notes that this is their first reserve quality Pinot Noir since 1998—a remarkable statement. It reaches for that extra something without blowing itself out of proportion, retaining the varietal elegance so nicely displayed in the regular 2008 bottling. This is bigger, tighter and harder—with more tannic weight—than that wine, and should be cellared while you drink up its stable mate."
Matteo 2016 Ice Wine Semillon (Wahluke Slope),Matteo,Dessert,Ice Wine,"Sémillon, Sémillon","Wahluke Slope, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",9.1%,$40,92,Sean P. Sullivan,"All coming from Rosebud Vineyard and having a whopping 27.2 g/L of residual sugar, this slightly browned wine offers aromas of brown sugar and crème brûlée. It's intensely rich on the palate, with dried pineapple and honey flavors. A long finish ups the interest."
Vokel 2016 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Vokel,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",15.5%,$70,89,Virginie Boone,"Thick and intensely ripe, this appellation red is hearty and substantial on the palate, a richly interwoven mix of dried herb, strawberry and cola."
Donna Olga 2014  Brunello di Montalcino,Donna Olga,Red,,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14%,,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Underbrush, leather and a whiff of dark-skinned berry come together on this. Reflecting the cool, wet vintage, this is rather light-bodied and loose knit for Brunello and already extremely approachable, offering Morello cherry and hints of coffee and a clove note alongside dusty, loose-knit tannins and bright acidity. Drink through 2021."
Dry Creek Vineyard 2003 Heritage Zinfandel (Sonoma County),Dry Creek Vineyard,Red,Heritage,Zinfandel,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",,VivinoWine.com,87,,"Dry Creek Vineyard knows Zin, and it shows in this dry, balanced and attractive wine. It has Zin's briary, brambly berry richness, with smooth tannins and a complex mouthfeel. As good as it is, it would be even better with greater intensity of fruit."
Luca Bosio 2013  Barolo,Luca Bosio,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$45,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas suggesting rose, iris and red berry are front and center. The linear medium-bodied palate offers sour cherry, cranberry, white pepper and star anise alongside close-grained tannins and fresh acidity. It has a firm drying finish. Drink 2021–2028."
Château Bertinerie 2012 Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),Château Bertinerie,Red,Réserve,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",14%,$30,89,Roger Voss,"From selected parcels on the Bertinerie vineyard, this is still a young, firmly structured wine. Red berry fruits offer a contrast to the solid tannins and rich texture. The wood aging still shows, giving a spicy character that will integrate as the wine matures. Drink from 2017."
Fratelli Alessandria 2011 Gramolere  (Barolo),Fratelli Alessandria,Red,Gramolere,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",15%,$64,93,Kerin O’Keefe,"Alluring scents of perfumed berry, underbrush, pipe tobacco and leather come together on this firmly structured wine. The palate delivers mature black cherry, crushed raspberry, sage, rosemary, clove and a hint of cured meat. It's extremely well balanced thanks to assertive, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity."
Ravenswood 2000 Belloni Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Ravenswood,Red,Belloni,Zinfandel,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$35,89,,"A dark, peppery wine that contains just enough Zinfandel to quality for a varietal label, plus Petite Sirah, Carignane and Alicante Bouschet. In other words, an old-fashioned field blend. It is a well-made wine, and the minor varietals seem to add earth and tannins."
Gruet 2011 Sauvage Sparkling (America),Gruet,Sparkling,Sauvage,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","America, US",12%,$27,87,Fiona Adams,"Made from 100% Chardonnay, this shows lemon, apple and nectarine on the nose with hints of croisant. Spritely bubbles quickly fade, leaving honeydew, green apple, nectarine and a hint of pastry. The finish is fresh with lemon juice and tart apple."
Chelan Wine Company 2006 LEHM Estate Pinot Gris (Chelan County),Chelan Wine Company,White,LEHM Estate,,"Chelan County, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$20,88,Paul Gregutt,"I believe this is the first vintage for the LEHM estate Pinot Gris; the young vines need a few more years to pull the flavors out. But this is a good start, very crisp and clean and well-defined, with intriguing hints of apple and pear and light herb. The finish continues gracefully, adding notes of rock and pepper to the mix."
Valentín Bianchi 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Valentín Bianchi,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.1%,$16,88,Michael Schachner,"Dusty floral plum flavors are fresh, not over-extracted. Solid but regular on the palate, this tastes of oaky spicy dried cherry and plum along with tobacco. Latent acidity and grabby tannins make the finish abrasive."
García Figuero 2003 Tinto Figuero 12  (Ribera del Duero),García Figuero,Red,Tinto Figuero 12,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$30,89,Michael Schachner,"Young and jumpy at first, with early lactic notes. Airing allows this wine to show ripe berry aromas and flavors with ample shadings of oak-based vanilla and chocolate. Saturated and full; this wine gets it right. Drink through 2008."
Nickel & Nickel 2007 Harris Vineyard Merlot (Oakville),Nickel & Nickel,Red,Harris Vineyard,Merlot,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",14.6%,$50,89,,"Raspingly dry and fierce in tannins, this Merlot is quite different from other Bordeaux-style red wines from Oakville that are ripe and lush. Doesn't offer much reward now due to the astringency, but has a solid core of blackberries. Hard to know if the fruit will outlast the tannins."
Latah Creek 2012 Monarch Reserve Zephyr Ridge Vineyards Petite Sirah (Horse Heaven Hills),Latah Creek,Red,Monarch Reserve Zephyr Ridge Vineyards,Petite Sirah,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.5%,$30,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"Brooding aromas of dill, purple fruit, vanilla and wood spice are followed by full dark cherry flavors backed by a wall of firm yet still accessible tannins."
Frieden-Berg 2014 Feinherb Elbling (Mosel),Frieden-Berg,White,Feinherb,"Elbling, Other White","Mosel, Germany",11.5%,$16,89,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Fresh apple, pear and lemon flavors have a crystalline edge in this just-off-dry example of Elbling, an unusual white variety grown in the Mosel. It's zesty and spry, finishing with a delicious murmur of lime-pith bitterness. Drink now."
Foxen 1997 Morehouse Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),Foxen,Red,Morehouse Vineyard,,"Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",,$35,91,,"Shows plum, chocolate, smoke, coffee and tobacco notes. Very rich and fruity, with pretty tannins. Soft but rich. Balanced and harmonious, and very dry."
Nieto Senetiner 2005 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Nieto Senetiner,Red,Reserva,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.5%,$9,85,Michael Schachner,"The wood is a bit forced, and overall this wine has a heavy, full-fruited personality. But the depth and ripeness are pretty nice and the blackberry, dark plum and cassis flavors are earnest. A bit tannic and not all that varietal."
Mercouri Estate 2008 Folói White (Pisatis),Mercouri Estate,White,Folói,White Blend,"Pisatis, Greece",12.6%,$14,87,Susan Kostrzewa,"This wine has a touch of weight on the nose and palate—a result of the Viognier and Roditis in the blend. Fresh flowers and citrus on the nose lead into minerals, spice and exotic fruit on the palate. The wine is medium-bodied but maintains acidity."
Franck Bonville 2012 Pur Mesnil Grand Cru Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),Franck Bonville,Sparkling,Pur Mesnil Grand Cru Brut,Chardonnay,"Champagne, Champagne, France",12.5%,$75,94,Roger Voss,"This wine comes from Le Mesnil, one of the top villages in the Côte des Blancs, and is produced from only Grand Cru vineyards. It is as textured and mineral as a young wine like this should be. White fruit shows through the concentrated texture and will become more dominant as the wine matures. Drink from 2020."
Ca' Nova 2008  Ghemme,Ca' Nova,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Ghemme, Piedmont, Italy",13.5%,$38,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, tobacco, wild berry and a balsamic note take shape in the glass. The elegantly structured palate offers black cherry, cranberry, white pepper, clove and grilled herb that lead into a mineral-driven finish. It's young but well balanced, with austere but fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2016–2028."
Rieflé 2011 Zinnkoepflé Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Pinot Gris (Alsace),Rieflé,Dessert,Zinnkoepflé Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",14%,$45,93,Roger Voss,"Gold in color and unctuously sweet, this is a dense wine. The sweetness is cut with a dry edge and some fresh acidity. It tastes delicious now with flavors of wild honey and apricot skins, but it will certainly age well. Drink until 2024."
Novella 2005 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),Novella,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",12.8%,$10,84,,"Zesty, clean and fruity, with ripe grapefruit juice, fig and melon flavors. This SB finishes with a slightly sweet flourish of honey. From the beach to the patio, it'll be just fine."
Helix by Reininger 2015 Phinny Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),Helix by Reininger,Red,Phinny Hill Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$30,87,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas bring heaping amounts of dried green pepper, along with raspberry, herb and pencil eraser. Plush, full-bodied cherry flavors follow. The tannins bring a dry grip. Give it time in the cellar to see if it comes around."
Lava Cap 2014 Petite Sirah (El Dorado),Lava Cap,Red,,Petite Sirah,"El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",15.7%,$32,92,Jim Gordon,"This wine is super dark in hue and packed full of blackberry, wood smoke and black pepper flavors. It brings a relatively light (for the varietal) mouthfeel considering that it does have a wealth of fine-grained tannins and elevated alcohol. Drink now with a steak or chop, or cellar until 2025 for more maturity and nuance."
Abarbanel 2000 Estate Bottled Gewurztraminer (Alsace),Abarbanel,White,Estate Bottled,"Gewürztraminer, Gewürztraminer","Alsace, Alsace, France",13.5%,$21,81,,"Kicks off with enticing aromas redolent of lychee and peach. On the palate if falters a bit, however, with a sugary quality that masks the fruit. The finish serves up pretty spice notes. Kosher."
Domaine Pfister 2016 Tradition Riesling (Alsace),Domaine Pfister,White,Tradition,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$29,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Zesty, lemony purity is evident from the start. The nose brims with lemon and the palate makes it shine even more. This freshness has a counterpoint in tangy concentration that shimmers with tropical hints of passion fruit. The finish is pure, crystalline and lasting."
Three Rivers 2003 Meritage (Columbia Valley (WA)),Three Rivers,Red,,"Meritage, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$39,91,Paul Gregutt,"This has some real strength to the fruit, which shows depth, nerve and muscle. There's a nice high note suggesting citrus, even grapefruit; below that some racy berry fruit flavors; then comes the impact of tannin and espresso. It all adds up to some real excitement in the mouth. A powerful wine that zings the palate and leaves you wanting more."
Skinner 2013 Eighteen Sixty-One Red (El Dorado),Skinner,Red,Eighteen Sixty-One,Rhône-style Red Blend,"El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.4%,$32,90,Jim Gordon,"There is a gentle side to this medium-bodied wine, as it offers aromatic complexity with slightly restrained fruit flavors. Light aromas like cedar shavings and black pepper give way to a smooth texture supported by moderate tannins, and pretty plum and pomegranate flavors."
Kasuari 2010 Syrah (Napa Valley),Kasuari,Red,,,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.1%,$39,83,,"Marred by aggressively hard tannins and acids, this Syrah's berry-cherry flavors finish thin and bitter, with a green edge. The chilly vintage took its toll. Drink up."
I Giusti e Zanza 2006 Perbruno Syrah (Toscana),I Giusti e Zanza,Red,Perbruno,,"Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$35,93,,"Tobacco, spice, black pepper corn, clove and cured meats create a powerful and inviting wine that would pair well with the heartiest of meat dishes. This excellent expression is very representative of Syrah from sun-drenched Tuscany and it offers a smooth texture and polished tannins with a blast of espresso on the close. Drink after 2012."
Wohlmuth 2013 Hochsteinriegl Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),Wohlmuth,White,Hochsteinriegl,Sauvignon Blanc,"Südsteiermark, Austria",13.5%,$40,91,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Hints of ripe yellow pears with just a suspicion of passionfruit dominate the nose. The palate is intense and balanced, the lushness of the fruit brightened by a tight streak of refreshing acidity. Racy and versatile."
Pondera 2012 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Pondera,Red,Stillwater Creek Vineyard,,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.3%,$38,90,Sean P. Sullivan,"Aromas of raspberry, coffee, herbs, smoke and baking spices are austere on the nose. The fruit and barrel flavors are bright and tart, showing a lot of polish, detail and length."
BiancaVigna 2017 Rive di Ogliano Brut Nature  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),BiancaVigna,Sparkling,Rive di Ogliano Brut Nature,"Glera, Italian White","Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore, Veneto, Italy",11.5%,$23,93,Kerin O’Keefe,"Loaded with finesse, this radiant sparkler has delicate, enticing aromas of fragrant spring blossom, white stone fruit and citrus. The vibrant palate delivers green apple, peach and tangerine before a tangy, bone-dry finish. It's balanced and elegant, with bright acidity and a silky mousse."
Left Coast Cellars 2013 Cali's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Left Coast Cellars,Red,Cali's Cuvée,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$24,87,Paul Gregutt,"Production has climbed on this entry-level Pinot. Light fruit flavors mix plums and strawberries, with a subtext of clean earth and chocolate. The finish turns a bit chalky."
Plan Pégau 2017 Rosé (Vin de France),Plan Pégau,Rose,,Rosé,"Vin de France, France Other, France",13.5%,$21,87,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Initial whiffs of smoke and flint take some time to dissipate here but eventually open to prettier raspberry and plum notes. It's a savory rosé, with slightly muted red cherry and berry flavors edged by exotic spice, bramble and delicate tannins. With its firm structure, it's best served with dinner."
Castello di Bossi 2009 Corbaia Red (Toscana),Castello di Bossi,Red,Corbaia,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$65,92,,"Too young to drink now, this blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon shows all the requisites to be an age-worthy wine. The quality of the fruit is rich, the acidity is bright, and the tannins will carry the wine forward during its slow evolution."
Raymond 2001 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),Raymond,Red,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rutherford, Napa, California, US",,$50,88,,"Opens with a burst of smoky new oak, cherry and menthol notes, then reveals additional layers of currant and mocha. A little soft, plush in the mouth, almost fat. Certainly an accessible wine."
Grandes Serres 2019 Les Portes du Castelas White (Côtes du Rhône),Grandes Serres,White,Les Portes du Castelas,Rhône-style White Blend,"Côtes du Rhône, Rhône Valley, France",13%,$16,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Waxy lemon peels and strikes of salt lend refreshment to this supple blend of Grenache Blanc and Marsanne. Matured in 15% new oak, it balances fresh, primary grapefruit and white-pear flavors against lingering hints of smoke and cashew. Easy drinking and crisp on the finish, it's at peak now but should hold through 2023."
Central Coast Group Project 2013 Blood Orange White (Santa Barbara County),Central Coast Group Project,White,Blood Orange,White Blend,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",14.9%,$65,90,Matt Kettmann,"A numeric score on this wine is almost silly, as it's about as bizarre as wine gets. A shade of yellowish orange in the glass, this bottling shows aromas of vermouth, wood varnish, cherry and, yes, blood orange on the nose. The palate combines iron, sour peach, walnut oil and pine much like a Sherry. Fascinating, though not for the mainstream."
La Casa Dell'Orco 2010  Fiano di Avellino,La Casa Dell'Orco,White,,"Fiano, Italian White","Fiano di Avellino, Southern Italy, Italy",13%,$20,87,,"A popular choice in Rome and southern Italy, Fiano di Avellino is a perfect seafood and shellfish white wine. There's crispness and brightness here, all backed by easy pear, peach and citrus aromas."
Domaine de Chevalier 2010  Pessac-Léognan,Domaine de Chevalier,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,,95,Roger Voss,"Firm and closed, this is a wine with so much power and concentration. It also has beautiful fruit, smooth and opulent, that merges into the complex tannins and brooding, dark structure. It will take many years for this wine to open up."
Pieve Vecchia 2010 Albatrello  (Montecucco),Pieve Vecchia,Red,Albatrello,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Montecucco, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$18,87,,"A blend of Sangiovese and Alicante, this plush wine shows simple tones of black fruit, worn leather and cherry. The nose is a bit muddled, and there's a subtle touch of sweet soda on the close."
Château Roquevieille 2010  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,Château Roquevieille,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,,88,Roger Voss,"Firm and structured, this powerful wine has considerable aging potential. Black plum skins, dark tannins and ripe, juicy fruitiness are all piled into the solid structure. Drink from 2016."
Le Cadeau 2010 Côte Est Pinot Noir (Oregon),Le Cadeau,Red,Côte Est,Pinot Noir,"Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",13.1%,$48,92,Paul Gregutt,"An elegant version of the Côte Est, this is an Oregon Pinot sourced from the winery's vineyard in the Chehalem Mountains that's bursting with juicy goodness. It's a wine with finesse, full of tart fruit flavors like cranberry and cherry, tight and well-suited for 10 or more years in the cellar."
Rudolf Fürst 2016 Pur Mineral Weisser Burgunder (Franken),Rudolf Fürst,White,Pur Mineral,"Weisser Burgunder, Pinot Blanc","Franken, Germany",12.5%,$40,93,Anna Lee C. Iijima,The name “Pur Mineral” is an apt descriptor for this intensely mineral wine full of dusty slate and river rock complexities. It's luminously fruity too offering pristine Muscat grape and pear accented by a hint of exotic spice. It is dry in style yet rich and expansive in mouthfeel.
Viña Cobos 2013 Bramare Malbec (Uco Valley),Viña Cobos,Red,Bramare,Malbec,"Uco Valley, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.5%,$45,91,Michael Schachner,"Ripe, heady, slightly malty aromas of blackberry and plum set this on its way. In the mouth, there are scratchy, unresolved tannins and acidity to deal with along with salty flavors of oak, plum and cassis. A lasting, oaky finish with vanilla and butter notes provides for a good close out. Drink through 2020."
Martinez Gassiot 2000 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),Martinez Gassiot,Port/Sherry,Late Bottled Vintage,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",,,90,Roger Voss,"Very structured, dense and powerful, this wine is finely shaped, with acidity balancing the solid fruit."
Finca Patagonia 2014 Reserve Merlot (Maule Valley),Finca Patagonia,Red,Reserve,Merlot,"Maule Valley, Chile",13.5%,$16,87,Michael Schachner,"Gritty black-fruit aromas come with notes of bell pepper and green herbs as well as coffee grounds. A snappy, tough, drawing palate delivers peppery, blackened spice and herbal berry flavors prior to a crisp, tight finish with fresh acidity."
Amavi 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Amavi,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.2%,$29,87,Paul Gregutt,"Sourced from five excellent Walla Walla vineyards, this wine spent about 15 months in barrel, one quarter new. It has dried cherry fruit, almost like an Amarone in style, though with no sweetness. Tannins are drying and finish with a slight bitterness. Tasted twice from different bottles."
Muhr-Van der Niepoort 2013 Samt & Seide Blaufränkisch (Carnuntum),Muhr-Van der Niepoort,Red,Samt & Seide,"Blaufränkisch, Other Red","Carnuntum, Austria",13%,$29,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"There is nothing obvious about this wine: everything is subtle and elegant. The nose holds back and the taut palate only unfurls slowly to show a floral, fruity wine that reminds one of crimson peony petals as much as of dark, juicy cherries. Yet there is nothing facile about this. It is the silky-smooth texture, however, that delivers the killer blow. A most sensuous, intriguing wine of great elegance. Little wonder: its name means silk and velvet"
Trinchero 2010 Central Park West Vineyard Cabernet Franc (St. Helena),Trinchero,Red,Central Park West Vineyard,Cabernet Franc,"St. Helena, Napa, California, US",14.9%,$50,85,,"With cherry, green herb and mint flavors, this Cab Franc is elegantly structured, but lacks the richness you want in a California Bordeaux-style wine."
La Chablisienne 2011 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),La Chablisienne,White,Les Clos Grand Cru,Chardonnay,"Chablis, Burgundy, France",,$75,94,Roger Voss,"The most serious of the Chablis Grand Crus has produced here a wine that combines that firmer nature with generous yellow fruits, toast and tender acidity. A strong sense of structure partners with a steely core and mineral texture that firms up the fruit and promises aging. Drink from 2017."
Cuillin Hills 2005 The Dungeon Syrah (Washington),Cuillin Hills,Red,The Dungeon,,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$27,88,Paul Gregutt,"This is smooth and full, and has got the requisite black cherry fruit, some lemon rind and pineapple peeking through the acids. In the finish are suggestions, just a lick, of tobacco, wild cherry, maybe sweet ham. Gets interesting in the end, though it remains very tart and acidic."
Occam's Razor 2005 Shiraz (Heathcote),Occam's Razor,Red,,,"Heathcote, Victoria, Australia",15%,$39,88,Joe Czerwinski,"Heathcote Shiraz often has an earthy tinge to it, and this offering is no exception. There's loam and a touch of molasses on the nose, then lightly roasted berries, earth and a hint of mushroom in the mouth. It's large in scale (15% alcohol), but framed by some firm tannins that should soften in 2–3 years."
Mineral Wines 2016 Zinfandel (Calaveras County),Mineral Wines,Red,,Zinfandel,"Calaveras County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.9%,$29,88,Jim Gordon,"Ultrasmooth and mouthfilling, this full-bodied wine boasts ripe plummy jammy aromas and flavors, a rather soft mouthfeel and relaxed tannins."
Christian Fischer 2004 Premium Merlot Merlot (Thermenregion),Christian Fischer,Red,Premium Merlot,Merlot,"$50,Buy Now",,$50,90,Roger Voss,"There's considerable richness in this broad, generous, velvet-  textured wine that brings out the red fruit and ripeness. The 18-months barrel aging have not dampened the fruit, but have certainly contributed to the power of this impressive wine."
Paris Valley Road 2013 Chardonnay (Monterey County),Paris Valley Road,White,,Chardonnay,"Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",14%,$14,87,Matt Kettmann,"Salted grapefruit skins, browned butter and a toasted-nut element arise on the nose of this wine from a vineyard near the tiny Salinas Valley town of San Ardo. It offers acidic energy and tight minerality on the palate, with ripe aromatic apples showing midway through the sip."
Mayer am Pfarrplatz 2014 Pinot Noir (Vienna),Mayer am Pfarrplatz,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Vienna, Austria",13.5%,$28,90,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Hints of smoke frame this very traditional, authentic Pinot made in time-honoured Austrian fashion. The balance and freshness of red fruit is borne in a very graceful structure and just cries out for food. Light bodied but with lovely depth."
HKG 2011 North Bridge Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),HKG,Red,North Bridge,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.6%,$42,90,,"Made in a fruit-forward style, this brims with rich, ripe flavors of raspberries and strawberries. It has a touch of sautéed wild mushrooms that brings a pleasant earthiness. It's a good wine to drink now, and should evolve nicely over the next six years."
King Estate 2019 Inscription Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),King Estate,Red,Inscription,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",12.9%,$20,90,Paul Gregutt,"A classy package adorns this affordable wine. Cranberry and black cherry fruit come to a solid, focused core, with stiff acidity backing substantial yet smooth tannins."
Hightower 2006 Pepper Bridge Vineyard Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Hightower,Red,Pepper Bridge Vineyard Red Wine,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$28,88,Paul Gregutt,"The blend is 88% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Sauvignon. From the first sniff to the last give-me-more swallow, this broadly delicious wine is going to win a lot of friends. The pretty strawberry and cherry fruit is generously endowed with mocha and chocolate, but the barrel flavors are not overbearing. Not one for the cellar; enjoy this wine in the fullness of its youth."
Windemere 1997 Cathy MacGregor Vyd Signature Chardonnay (Edna Valley),Windemere,White,Cathy MacGregor Vyd Signature,Chardonnay,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$32,87,,"Intensely smoky and earthy aromas, with a deeply toasted, almost burnt-match quality. There are pear, lemon and nutty flavors on the palate. Long finish with earthy, nutty, spicy elements. Large-scaled and refreshingly unique, if not uniformly liked. A challenging and controversial wine for our panel."
Etude 2002 Pinot Noir (Carneros),Etude,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",,$40,89,,"Rather herbal and spicy, bursting with anise, Asian spicebox aromas. Cherries and sweet herbs in  the mouth, with a spicy finish. The soft tannins make it instantly drinkable."
Seifried 2014 Riesling (Nelson),Seifried,White,,Riesling,"Nelson, New Zealand",12%,$18,88,Joe Czerwinski,"Seyfried always seems to do well with aromatic varieties, perhaps because of the family's Germanic roots. This Riesling includes a hint of honey on the nose, plus melon and pear fruit and a lingering hint of gingery spice on the finish."
Château le Bon Pasteur 2009 Barrel sample  (Pomerol),Château le Bon Pasteur,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pomerol, Bordeaux, France",,,93,Roger Voss,"92-94 Barrel sample. Dense, with impressive solid tannins and powerful fruit. The wine is smooth at first, then structure comes through with a final dry core."
Tesoro della Regina 2014 Pinot Grigio (Valdadige),Tesoro della Regina,White,,Pinot Grigio,"Valdadige, Veneto, Italy",12.5%,$17,84,Kerin O’Keefe,"This simple white offers delicate hints of pear and citrus while vibrant acidity gives it a crisp, short finish. It's a quaffing wine to pour at picnics and other informal get-togethers."
Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2013 Private Collection Red (Tejo),Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo,Red,Private Collection,Portuguese Red,"Tejo, Portugal",15%,$14,87,Roger Voss,"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Castelão, this is a wine that is almost too rich, too intense. Its dense texture and background of tannins are balanced with black currant acidity; however, the high alcohol does show with pepper and tongue-burning spice. That won't go away, although the texture will soften. Drink from 2017."
Domus Vitae 2005  Brunello di Montalcino,Domus Vitae,Red,,"Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese","Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$60,89,,"Here's a smoky, earthy Brunello that shows sophisticated use of oak to render aromas of toast, spice and leather. There are fresh fruit nuances here as well— mainly cherry and blackberry—and the wine is bright, tonic, crisp and relatively lean on the close."
Bocopa 2015 Conde de Alicante Selección Rosé (Alicante),Bocopa,Rose,Conde de Alicante Selección,Rosé,"Alicante, Levante, Spain",11.5%,$9,86,Michael Schachner,"Cherry and plum aromas are light, generic and clean. This feels mostly right, with moderate acidity creating a solid mouthfeel. Plum, citrus and herbal flavors finish round and balanced."
Conde de Altava 2009 Crianza  (Rioja),Conde de Altava,Red,Crianza,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$15,88,Michael Schachner,"Dusty berry fruit aromas blend with milk chocolate and lactic notes on what amounts to a mildly oaky nose. The mouthfeel, meanwhile, is juicy and just right. Flavors of berry fruits, licorice and raisin finish full, minty and ripe, with lasting freshness."
Au Sommet 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),Au Sommet,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Atlas Peak, Napa, California, US",14.3%,$250,94,,"Very rich and opulent, in the Heidi Barrett style, this Cabernet is sweetly jammy but somewhat direct in blackberries, cherries and raspberries. The finish is extraordinarily long and spicy, an indication that it's a wine for the cellar. Firm tannins and fine acidity confirm its ageability. Hold this flashy, decadent wine until 2016 and then try it again."
Château la France 2019 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),Château la France,Rose,,Rosé,"Bordeaux Rosé, Bordeaux, France",14.5%,$8,86,Roger Voss,"Cabernet Franc takes the lead in this blend, giving spiciness and richness. It is a shame that the wine also has high alcohol that adds a pepper edge to the weight. The wine is more for food and is ready to drink."
Volker Eisele Family Estate 2004 Family Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Volker Eisele Family Estate,Red,Family Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.8%,$40,87,,"This is just a little too soft, sweet and ripe, although it retains the classic structure and elegance you demand from the venerable name Eisele. The flavor of sugared crushed blackberries, cherries and caramelly vanilla suggest drinking now."
Château Jean-Faure 2008  Saint-Émilion,Château Jean-Faure,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,,91,Roger Voss,"Rich and ripe, this is a full-bodied wine that has great plum and sweet blackberry flavors and good concentration. Firm in texture, the dusty tannins giving further density. For aging over 5–6 years."
Domaine Bousquet 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato),Domaine Bousquet,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Tupungato, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$14,85,Michael Schachner,"Saucy berry and tea aromas are herbal, earthy and stewed. This feels full but syrupy. Flavors of cooked berry, molasses and mocha finish sweet and soupy, with only a touch of acidic offset."
Albert Bichot 2016 Domaine Adélie en Pierre Milley  (Mercurey),Albert Bichot,Red,Domaine Adélie en Pierre Milley,Pinot Noir,"Mercurey, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$46,92,Roger Voss,"Still full of youthful tannins, this wine has both richness and structure. The potential is there, with the dense character of the tannins that are about to soften. Wild-berry flavors and a juicy aftertaste add to the promise. Drink from 2022."
Château Rieussec 2016 Carmes de Rieussec  (Sauternes),Château Rieussec,Dessert,Carmes de Rieussec,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Sauternes, Bordeaux, France",14%,$20,91,Roger Voss,"Packed with ripe, honeyed Sémillon, this wine has richness while also keeping plenty of freshness.

Château Haut Cormier 2018  Bordeaux Supérieur,Château Haut Cormier,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux Supérieur, Bordeaux, France",13%,$14,87,Roger Voss,"A rich blend of the three main Bordeaux grapes, this generous wine offers spice, tannins and plenty of black-currant fruits. It has the potential to be well balanced, fruity and structured. Drink from mid-2021."

Soy, dried herb, sage and black currant notes pepper the scene."
P.J. Valckenberg 2016 Dornfelder (Rheinhessen),P.J. Valckenberg,Red,,"Dornfelder, Other Red","Rheinhessen, Germany",10%,$14,85,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Sweet-tart red cherry and berry flavors are plump and juicy in this fresh, easy drinking Dornfelder. It's not a complicated wine but balanced in sweetness and acidity. Drink now."
Turning Leaf 1997 Reserve Merlot (Sonoma County),Turning Leaf,Red,Reserve,Merlot,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,VivinoGary's Wine,82,Joe Czerwinski,Lightly perfumed earthy aromas carry a hint of cinnamon. Dull cherry and pungent earth flavors finish with a sharp edge.
Morgan 2003 Rosella's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),Morgan,White,Rosella's Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",,$35,91,,"You can smell the minerals in this tight, compelling wine. It has an aroma suggesting cold metal, even a touch of diesel, floating above the guava, pineapple, nectarine and peach flavors. Smoky oak and zesty acidity help make this Chard very complex and satisfying."
Maison Deux-Fleurs 2017  Coteaux Bourguignons,Maison Deux-Fleurs,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Coteaux Bourguignons, Burgundy, France",12.5%,$23,84,Roger Voss,"This blend of Gamay and Pinot Noir is soft, with cherry flavors and gentle tannins.

Château de Fontenille 2018  Bordeaux,Château de Fontenille,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",14.5%,$15,88,Roger Voss,"Dominated by Merlot, this wine is rich and luscious. Bold tannins and ripe blackberry flavors make it both structured and fruity. It is set to develop well, so drink from mid-2021."
Constantia Glen 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Constantia),Constantia Glen,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Constantia, South Africa",13.5%,$30,87,Susan Kostrzewa,"A nose of herbs, kiwi, smoke and minerals gives this white an intriguing start. On the palate, it's crisp and clean, with flavors of tropical fruit, herbs and spice unfolding over a minerally backbone. Ageable and terroir driven."
Crux 2013 G-S-M (Russian River Valley),Crux,Red,,"G-S-M, Rhône-style Red Blend","Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$42,88,Virginie Boone,"Made from 48% Grenache, 37% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre, this is an earthy wine, full of mushroomy herbal notes that lean into a trove of eucalyptus. Leather rides along a smooth texture of baked and dried cherry."
Vincent Wine Company 2015 Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),Vincent Wine Company,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.1%,$27,87,Paul Gregutt,"Vincent's Pinot Noirs are fermented with native yeasts in a mix of once-used and older barrels. This bottling opens with fresh strawberry and raspberry flavors, lemony acids, and an underpinning of wet stone. It's on the lighter side and was made (and priced) for everyday enjoyment."
Vignobles Bodillard 2018 Corcelette Cuvée Alexia  (Morgon),Vignobles Bodillard,Red,Corcelette Cuvée Alexia,Gamay,"Morgon, Beaujolais, France",13%,$24,85,Roger Voss,"This wine's dry tannins still dominate the fruit, giving a tough dimension. It needs to soften and release the pent-up black fruits. Drink from late 2021."
Bethel Heights 2015 The High Wire Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills),Bethel Heights,White,The High Wire,Chardonnay,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.2%,$95,95,Paul Gregutt,"This is from an old-vines Wente clone, planted in 1977. You'll notice the texture first, layers of well-proportioned citrus, lemon zest, wet stone and hints of barrel toast. The length and detail are superb, and though drinking well already, this is a wine that will reward cellaring. Drink now through the 2020s."
Pradorey 2001 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),Pradorey,Red,Crianza,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$19,86,Michael Schachner,"Riper and deeper than some in this class, but arguably overoaked and roasted, such that the finish tastes like burnt coffee and the bouquet smells of peeled tire rubber. In between look for plum, blackberry, cumin and black pepper."
Domaine Serene 2012 Yamhill Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Domaine Serene,Red,Yamhill Cuvée,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.6%,$45,92,Paul Gregutt,"This cuvée offers the pleasures of sweet, sappy red fruits, soft tannins and broad swaths of caramel, toasted hazelnuts and mocha. It coats the tongue with flavor and has a sort of insistence that the next sip will be even better."
Fattoria Petrolo 2001 San Petrolo White (Tuscany),Fattoria Petrolo,Dessert,San Petrolo,White Blend,"Tuscany, Tuscany, Italy",11%,$60,97,,"In a league with Italy's best dessert wines, San Petrolo is a superrich and concentrated wine that almost has a hard time pouring out of the bottle. The wine does indeed have the consistency of maple syrup, with a deep brown color and gorgeous aromas of toasted almond, chestnut honey, crème caramel and crème brûlée."
Cave de Gan 2012 Grains de Béarn Rosé (Béarn),Cave de Gan,Rose,Grains de Béarn,Rosé,"Béarn, Southwest France, France",12%,$14,85,Roger Voss,"Full and rounded, this warm rosé has some weight. A food-friendly selection, it has a dry, tangy character, textured red-currant flavor and tight final acidity."
Anselmo Mendes 2016 Parcela Unica Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),Anselmo Mendes,White,Parcela Unica,"Alvarinho, Albariño","Vinho Verde, Portugal",12.5%,$35,93,Roger Voss,"As its name suggests, this wine comes from a single parcel of Alvarinho. Its richness and concentration is impressive. So are the apple, pear and citrus fruits that are now maturing into a ripe, spicy and nutty wine. At the end, the wine has a fine mature balance that makes it ready to drink."
Buena Vista 2013 The Count's Selection Pinot Gris (Sonoma Valley),Buena Vista,White,The Count's Selection,,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$25,90,Virginie Boone,"White pepper and matchstick come to the fore aromatically in this crisp white that's fuller bodied on the palate than one would expect given the aromatics. Apple and pear give a complex, autumnal fruit presence that leads up to a ripe, creamy finish."
Hyland 2017 Old Vine Gewürztraminer (McMinnville),Hyland,White,Old Vine,Gewürztraminer,"McMinnville, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.7%,$25,87,Paul Gregutt,"The back label posits this as a “dry” style, but there's plenty of fruit sweetness nonetheless. Peach and citrus rind flavors come with a sprinkling of powdered sugar. It's a fairly significant change from the aromatic and detailed 2016 version."
Cavalchina 2019 Amedeo  (Custoza Superiore),Cavalchina,White,Amedeo,White Blend,"Custoza Superiore, Veneto, Italy",13.5%,$22,92,Kerin O’Keefe,"Savory and delicious, this opens with alluring aromas of yellow spring wildflowers and ripe white stone fruit. Made with Garganega, Fernanda, Trebbiano Toscana and Trebbianello, it's delicious and loaded with finesse, delivering creamy white peach, Bartlett pear and lemon drop candy before closing on an almond note. While it's great now, it will also age and develop even more depth. Drink through 2027."
Charter Oak 2010 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),Charter Oak,Red,Monte Rosso Vineyard,Zinfandel,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma, California, US",15%,$48,88,,"High alcohol and exceptionally ripe fruit are the hallmarks of this mountain vineyard. In this Zinfandel, they express themselves as blackberries, cherries and mocha that have a roasted edge, and a Port-like heat that is by no means unpleasant. But you do want to drink this Zin with dishes rich in beef, cheese and olive oil."
Domaine Sauvat 2016 Coquines Pinot Noir (Puy de Dôme),Domaine Sauvat,Red,Coquines,Pinot Noir,"Puy de Dôme, Loire Valley, France",12.5%,,85,Roger Voss,This is a young tannic wine. It needs time to show up the red fruits that are underneath the dryness. There is potential for a fine juicy softly textured future. Drink from 2018.
Dutton-Goldfield 2014 Dutton Ranch Walker Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Green Valley),Dutton-Goldfield,White,Dutton Ranch Walker Hill Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Green Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14%,$50,93,Virginie Boone,"This resplendent white offers a wealth of wet stone minerality and crisp, lemony acidity, with just a subtle hint of oak. From old vines, it boasts tangerine and anise flavors on the palate, with tropical notes of guava and mango and a jolt of nuttiness."
Boomtown 2013 Chardonnay (Washington),Boomtown,White,,Chardonnay,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",12.9%,$19,90,Paul Gregutt,"This well-built wine shows just the barest hint of barrel from fermentation and aging in neutral oak which seems to have rounded out the fruit and put some polish on the mouthfeel. Flavors are a tasty mix of lemon curd, honeysuckle, apple and peach, lightly spiced."
Dry Creek Vineyard 2018 Fumé Blanc (Sonoma County),Dry Creek Vineyard,White,,"Fumé Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc","Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$16,90,Virginie Boone,"This wine was given no time in oak and made entirely from grapes grown in Dry Creek and Russian River Valleys. It is lively, tart and fresh. Balanced flavors of lemon peel, lime and peach mingle around an earthy tease of fresh-cut grass."
Las Estelas 2017 Finca Mangato Alto de las Piedras Malbec (Tupungato),Las Estelas,Red,Finca Mangato Alto de las Piedras,Malbec,"Tupungato, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$20,90,Michael Schachner,"Plum and berry aromas are accented by a whiff of desert brush and hefty lemony oak. A powerfully built palate has a resiny feel to it, while oaky blackberry flavors show a strong barrel influence backed by herbal hints and smacking tannins. This is excellent for an inaugural wine, with room to improve in subsequent years."
Tenuta Vitalonga 2011 Phiculle Red (Umbria),Tenuta Vitalonga,Red,Phiculle,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Umbria, Central Italy, Italy",14%,$45,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"This blend of Cabernet Franc and Montelpulciano opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, blackberry and evident oak.

Zeitgeist 2017 Fanucchi Wood Road Vineyard Trousseau Gris (Russian River Valley),Zeitgeist,White,Fanucchi Wood Road Vineyard,"Trousseau Gris, Other White","Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.1%,$26,94,Virginie Boone,"Made to be fresh, fruity and enjoyed frequently, this wine is oily in lemon and apricot, with a refreshing, spritzy acidity that's both bright and complex. The vineyard is one of very few in the state to grow the variety and this producer has made it its mission to honor both the site and the grape. She does."
Carmen 2003 Classic Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Carmen,Red,Classic,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Maipo Valley, Chile",,$7,84,,"Solid Chilean Cab, with herbal notes and chewy cassis and chocolate flavors. Fine with burgers and the like."
Kokomo 2006 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),Kokomo,Red,,Zinfandel,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$24,88,,"Nice and peppery-spicy, this Zin shows how well the variety performs in Dry Creek Valley, one of its natural homes. There's a rich coating of new oak that adds vanilla and smoky chocolate flavor, but the wild blackberry, raspberry and blueberry fruit shines through."
Avanzi 2018 Sirmione  (Lugana),Avanzi,White,Sirmione,"Turbiana, Italian White","Lugana, Lombardy, Italy",13%,$19,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Lightly scented, this has subtle aromas of yellow stone fruit and a floral note.

Pearl and Stone 2016 Resolution Peaks Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Pearl and Stone,Red,Resolution Peaks,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.5%,$42,90,Paul Gregutt,"Sourced from the Two Blondes and Dionysus vineyards, this is principally Cabernet Sauvignon, with the last 15% a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Flavors of sweet tomato, pretty strawberry and a hint of cherries account for the fruit, alongside an earthy, herbal component and a streak of coffee. The overall balance is good and the acids bring a note of orange citrus."
Stadt Krems 2009 Wachtberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),Stadt Krems,White,Wachtberg Reserve,Grüner Veltliner,"Kremstal, Austria",13.5%,$37,91,Roger Voss,"This is powerful, rich Grüner, one that brings out the pepper character as well as apricot and honey. There is a dense texture in this concentrated and well-balanced wine. It needs to age for 3–4 years."
Domaine Cordaillat 2019 Rosé (Reuilly),Domaine Cordaillat,Rose,,Rosé,"Reuilly, Loire Valley, France",13%,$17,90,Roger Voss,"This delicious wine is rosé by virtue of the pink color of the Pinot Gris skin, taking the concept of blush to the extreme of paleness. Attractive and fruity, it has the lightest texture and the typical floral perfumes of Pinot Gris. Drink this wine now."
Pellegrini 2004 Cloverdale Ranch Merlot (Alexander Valley),Pellegrini,Red,Cloverdale Ranch,Merlot,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$22,82,,"Tough, dry and weedy, with astringent tannins. Clean, but not going anywhere."
Schild Estate 2004 Semillon (Barossa Valley),Schild Estate,White,,"Sémillon, Sémillon","Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",12.5%,$18,85,,"This is a petite-sized Sem with some plumpness in the mouth. Flavors are of citrus and straw, but aren't as concentrated as I'd like. Aromas are peachy and musky. Imported by Australian Wine Connection."
Bertrand-Delespierre NV Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),Bertrand-Delespierre,Sparkling,Premier Cru Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$52,88,Roger Voss,"Based in Chamery on the northern slopes of the Montagne de Reims, this producer has made an immediately attractive nonvintage wine. Fruity and with crisp acidity it hits a good point between dry and sweeter in the Brut range, making it very drinkable, with a crisp aftertaste."
Encore 2002 San Bernabe Vineyard White Medley White (Monterey),Encore,White,San Bernabe Vineyard White Medley,White Blend,"Monterey, Central Coast, California, US",,$18,87,,"From Monterra, a delicious blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Blanc, Muscat Canelli and Viognier.

Whitehall Lane 2003 Leonardini Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Whitehall Lane,Red,Leonardini Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$100,90,,"A very good Cab, a little young and in need of cellaring, but such is the fruit that you can drink it now. It's plush in black currant, crème de cassis and new oaky flavors wrapped in soft, velvety tannins, with a chocolaty, licorice finish. Should hold for a good ten years."
Sallier de la Tour 2007 Merlot (Sicilia),Sallier de la Tour,Red,,Merlot,"Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",14%,,86,,"A ripe and plumy expression, this wine is rich and velvety with loads of ripe cherry, blackberry and natural spice. The mouthfeel is soft, chewy and powerful."
Quinta da Pacheca 2016 Red (Douro),Quinta da Pacheca,Red,,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",13.5%,$10,85,Roger Voss,"This wine has attractive light tannins as well as layers of berry fruits and acidity.

Yatir 2014 Yatir Forest Red (Judean Hills),Yatir,Red,Yatir Forest,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Judean Hills, Israel",15%,,91,Mike DeSimone,This inky garnet-colored wine has a nose of blackberry and roast fennel bulb. It has flavors of freshly picked cherries and strawberries with touches of violet and orange blossom. Potent tannins are not entirely insurmountable thanks to vibrant acidity that really does its job on the surprisingly bright finish. Mevushal.
Domaine de la Renjarde 2007 Massif d'Uchaux Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages),Domaine de la Renjarde,Red,Massif d'Uchaux,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Côtes du Rhône Villages, Rhône Valley, France",13.5%,$12,86,Joe Czerwinski,"Fresh in style, especially for the hot, dry 2007 vintage, reflecting the slightly higher elevation of the Massif d'Uchaux, this medium-bodied wine offers oodles of cherry-berry fruit. It's nothing too serious or complex, just good, quaffable pleasure to consume over the next 2–3 years."
Feudi di San Gregorio 2015 Serpico Aglianico (Irpinia),Feudi di San Gregorio,Red,Serpico,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Irpinia, Southern Italy, Italy",14%,$100,93,Kerin O’Keefe,"Taut and linear, this opens with aromas of red berry, pipe tobacco and eucalyptus. The firm, elegantly structured palate delivers sour cherry, cassis, star anise and a hint of smoke before finishing on an accent of coffee. Taut, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2023–2035."
Franz Keller 2016 Franz Anton Schwarzer Adler Pinot Noir (Baden),Franz Keller,Red,Franz Anton Schwarzer Adler,Pinot Noir,"Baden, Germany",12.5%,$42,94,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Pristine, pure fruit abounds in this exceptionally fresh, invigorating red. Crisp red-cherry and -plum flavors are accented by crushed minerals, blossoms and tobacco. Full bodied and plump in mouthfeel, it's balanced by fresh acidity and a hint of ash reminiscent of the Kaiserstuhl's volcanic origins. Lovely already, it should gain depth and complexity through 2030."
Clos du Lac 2004 R Reserve Red (Amador County),Clos du Lac,Red,R Reserve,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Amador County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14%,$14,86,,"Black pepper aromas and flavors star in this dry Rhône-style blend.

On the palate, there is a whole world of pepper and lemon pith, held in a taut, tight and concentrated fashion that makes this variety such a joy."
Otazu 2011 Premium Cuvée Señorío de Otazu Red (Navarra),Otazu,Red,Premium Cuvée Señorío de Otazu,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Navarra, Northern Spain, Spain",14.5%,$12,86,Michael Schachner,"This Navarran blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo opens with mulchy aromas of compost, tomato and herbs as well as currant and plum. The palate is thick and syrupy in feel, with a mix of baked, stewy berry flavors offset by green notes. Herbal berry and chocolaty flavors control a rooty, sweet-tasting finish."

Apex 2002 Merlot (Yakima Valley),Apex,Red,,Merlot,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$30,88,Paul Gregutt,"Apex has just released this 2002, which makes it, as far as we know, the last of that vintage to see daylight. Dark and smoky, it is already heading into more mature, secondary fruit flavors, and has a pleasing softness throughout. Time has sanded away the rough edges of the tannins, and rounded out the herbal components as well. This is drinking very nicely, and gives you a cellared wine at a new wine price."
Roux Père et Fils 2006 Les Macherelles Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),Roux Père et Fils,White,Les Macherelles Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Chassagne-Montrachet, Burgundy, France",13.5%,,91,Roger Voss,"While there are plenty of toast, butter and ginger spice flavors here, this wine also shows the tight, more mineral side of Chassagne-Montrachet. It comes from the acidity and the dry edge of red apple skins. This powerful wine needs 2–3 years for the wood to calm down."
Black Stallion 2012 Pinot Grigio (California),Black Stallion,White,,Pinot Grigio,"California, California Other, California, US",13%,DrizlyVivino,88,,"This wine shows Pinot Grigio's bright, ripe lemongrass and peach flavors, touched with a kiss of honey. But it's balanced and crisp in acidity."

Toulouse 2007 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),Toulouse,White,,,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14.3%,$22,88,,"Off-dry to semi-sweet, this wine's honeysuckle, apricot, pineapple and Meyer lemon richness are balanced by zesty acidity."
Hayes Valley 2014 Zinfandel (Central Coast),Hayes Valley,Red,,Zinfandel,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$15,86,Matt Kettmann,"A solid wine for the price, this shows lush aromas of baked red cherries, vanilla, caramel and clove. The palate is more restrained with tart, somewhat rigid tannins that will allow more fruit and spice flavors to emerge with patience."
Beringer 2001 Bancroft Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Beringer,Red,Bancroft Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Howell Mountain, Napa, California, US",13.8%,$90,93,,"Like all of Beringer's 2001 gold letter single-vineyard Cabs, this one is a cellar laydown. It's hard in tannins now, a dry wine that leaves the palate rasping because it's so astringent. Yet the fruit is gigantically ripe, flooding the mouth with blackberries and cherries that are the essence of those fruits. With all that ripeness, the acidity is crisp and fine. Drink 2008–2020."
Hoodsport 1998 Gewürztraminer (Yakima Valley),Hoodsport,White,,Gewürztraminer,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$9,83,,"Has dense, heavy aromas of jasmine, cinnamon, rose petal, chocolate and citrus. Fruity and fairly sweet, with flavors of ripe peaches, nectarines and orange sherbet. Acidity is okay, but there's a heaviness, a thickness to the wine that makes it a bit awkward on the palate."

Enough cola, plum and licorice is showing to think this will be better in 2010. For now, it's a bit crisp and monolithic."
Atwater 2017 Dry Rosé of Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),Atwater,Rose,Dry Rosé of,Cabernet Franc,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12.6%,$17,86,Alexander Peartree,"A bit closed at first, this reveals tart strawberry, watermelon and pepper notes as it opens.

Iijima,"Hints of smoked nut, licorice and wild herb accent sumptuously ripe black plum and wild strawberry flavors here. The midpalate is fleshy and forward, cushioned by delicate acidity and fine, velvet tannins. Its open-knit demeanor is welcoming now but should drink well through 2026."
Sonoma-Cutrer 2007 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Sonoma-Cutrer,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$40,86,,"Minty and sharp in acidity, and not offering much richness now, especially at this price, although it does feel stylishly dry and elegant.

Arachon 2016 Evolution T FX T Red (Burgenland),Arachon,Red,Evolution T FX T,,"Burgenland, Austria",14%,$25,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Cinnamon, plum and blueberry send aromatic waves from the glass. The palate is rich and smooth but also shows inherent freshness and a crunchy, fine tannin structure. A juiciness starts to seep through these fine strictures and fills the senses with joy. Density, fruit, tannin—all is there in a very elegant, fresh fashion. The finish is long with juicy blueberry. Lovely now but will develop. Drink now–2030."

A shy line of cool-climate raspberry and strawberry are made brighter on the palate by zesty acidity. Begging for grilled meats, it becomes more substantial over time, offering leather and savory spice."

It's juicy and full bodied, doling out ripe raspberry, sour cherry, star anise and crushed herb framed in chewy tannins.

There's a stiffening frame of black licorice, suggesting some time in new wood. The wine seems to sit on the palate without any further development, and then just stops. A bit more bottle age is recommended; drink after 2020."
The Prisoner 2017 Red (Napa Valley),The Prisoner,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15.2%,VivinoWine Express,92,Virginie Boone,"The famous blend combines Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Syrah and Charbono from throughout the Napa Valley, combining the grapes into a robust, flavorful explosion of soft, richly rounded fruit and body.

Château Cheval Blanc 2014 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),Château Cheval Blanc,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,97,Roger Voss,"96–98. Barrel Sample.

Columbia Crest 2003 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Columbia Crest,Red,Reserve,Merlot,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,VivinoGary's Wine,88,Paul Gregutt,"This is barely Merlot—just 75%—and the rest is filled in with Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah. This definitely bumps up the tannins and brightens the natural berry flavors. Tart fruit and creamy vanilla finish with softly astringent tannins. Nothing spectacular, but very smooth drinking."

Addamo 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),Addamo,White,Reserve,Chardonnay,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",15.2%,$29,92,,"This is a new winery for me, but one to watch.

The palate is juicy at first, but soon the salty, yeasty, almost cheesy core spreads its savory magic, not without adding vivid apple notes. A very complex and deeply satisfying wine. The finish belongs to zesty, clean lemon."

Sullivan,"Pale in color, this 100% Grenache has arresting, complex aromas of candied strawberries, pomegranate, herbs, plum and orange peel.

Punset 2008 Campo Quadro  (Barbaresco),Punset,Red,Campo Quadro,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",,,88,,Organic and biodynamic Punset offers Nebbiolo-based wines that are very difficult to assess. Try them too young (as in this case) and the wines often lack clarity and balance. Wait ten years or more and they blossom into something very special indeed. The 2008 Campo Quadro illustrates this point exactly.
Domaine Bordenave 2016 Les Copains d'Abord  (Jurançon),Domaine Bordenave,Dessert,Les Copains d'Abord,"Gros Manseng, Other White","Jurançon, Southwest France, France",13%,$22,88,Roger Voss,"An open wine with a good balance between sweet honey and acidity, this is made to drink young.

One hundred percent varietal, and made from a single clone, it shows fabulous density and serious weight, with dramatically rich blackberry, currant and cedar flavors anchored by a firm minerality. For all its power, the wine is balanced and elegant. An ager, it will drink well for at least a decade."
San Simeon 2004 Merlot (Paso Robles),San Simeon,Red,,Merlot,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$24,85,,"Soft and gentle, with earthy, herb-infused cherry and currant flavors, this is a nice wine to drink now. It's dry and balanced, with a tannic, peppery tug that grounds the fruit."

The palate comes in with absolute freshness that showcases dark, luscious fruit reminiscent of both black cherry and elderberry. Hints of licorice and smoke add aromatic allure while supple tannins already reveal much of the juiciness at the core of this elegant, concentrated wine. Drink 2025–2040."
Binz 2017 White Grenache (Fiddletown),Binz,White,White,Grenache,"Fiddletown, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.5%,$24,90,Jim Gordon,A dance between tangy acidity and a creamy texture plays out wonderfully in this medium- to full-bodied wine.

Stevenot 2004 Olivia Tempranillo (California),Stevenot,Rose,Olivia,Tempranillo,"California, California Other, California, US",13.8%,$12,85,,"This is a nice, cheerful blush wine, but you should chill it well to stun the slight sweetness, which makes it a little insipid. Icy cold, it's refreshing, with strawberry, raspberry and vanilla flavors."

G D Vajra 1997  Barbera d'Alba,G D Vajra,Red,,Barbera,"Barbera d'Alba, Piedmont, Italy",13%,$17,88,,"A full dark-cherry, herb and toast nose.

Boheme 2013 Taylor Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Boheme,Red,Taylor Ridge Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.3%,$55,92,Virginie Boone,"This is a spicy, vibrantly realized wine from a coastal ridge five miles from the Pacific Ocean dusted in sandy, loam soils. It's planted entirely to the Swan clone, which can contribute an undeniable wildness to the variety. Baked cherry meets spearmint and clove, the acidity light and bright with plenty of texture atop the medium-sized body."
Frey 2018 Sun &amp; Rain Organic Chardonnay (Mendocino),Frey,White,Sun & Rain Organic,Chardonnay,"Mendocino, Mendocino County, California, US",13.9%,$17,91,Jim Gordon,"Oodles of enticing fruit flavors and deft oak spices give this full-bodied wine plenty to enjoy. It has a buttery, creamy richness both in flavor and texture, excellent concentration and a lingering finish."
Château Hoste-Blanc 2011 Vieilles Vignes  (Bordeaux Blanc),Château Hoste-Blanc,White,Vieilles Vignes,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Bordeaux Blanc, Bordeaux, France",,$25,89,Roger Voss,"This is a full-bodied wine with a rich texture. It has a creamy character, along with flavors of almond, toast and ripe green plum. Worth aging a year."
Kanonkop 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),Kanonkop,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",14%,$33,85,,"This indigo-colored wine has a cacophony of aromas ranging from barnyard and leather to eucalyptus and dark berry. The flavor profile is nearly identical, the eucalyptus taking on more of a balsam note and additional dashes of forest floor and spice. The gritty tannins may soften, but the acidity will always be high. This wine has a lot going on, but after four years it still doesn't mesh."
Domaines Schlumberger 2011 Les Princes Abbés Riesling (Alsace),Domaines Schlumberger,White,Les Princes Abbés,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,,89,Roger Voss,"This perfumed wine is very dry but has delicious and fragrant fruitiness. A slight steely character adds complexity and structure. Made from biodynamically farmed grapes, it is ready to drink."
Écluse 2014 Insider Red (Paso Robles),Écluse,Red,Insider,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.2%,$49,93,Matt Kettmann,"This excellent blend of 70% Cabernet Franc, 25% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon shows caramelized black cherry, mint chocolate chip and a bit of smoke on the dense nose. The palate's soft mouthfeel is held up by firm tannins that last deep into the finish, presenting rich cherry juice flavors, along with caramel, milk chocolate and pleasant oak character."
Craggy Range 2013 Aroha Te Muna Pinot Noir (Martinborough),Craggy Range,Red,Aroha Te Muna,Pinot Noir,"Martinborough, New Zealand",13.5%,,93,Joe Czerwinski,"A barrel selection off Craggy Range's estate vineyard in the Te Muna Road area of Martinborough, this isn't a huge blockbuster style, but one that favors elegance. The aromas and flavors are ripe, oozing with hints of plum, black cherry, cola and licorice, but what makes the wine special are its subtle spice shadings and silky texture. Drink now–2025."
Hajszan Neumann 2017 Ried Weisleiten White (Wiener Gemischter Satz),Hajszan Neumann,White,Ried Weisleiten,"Austrian white blend, White Blend","Wiener Gemischter Satz, Austria",13.5%,$35,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A touch of dried hay flowers and notions of ripe, red apple combine on the appetizing nose. The palate comes in with precise slenderness that highlights white apple and pear flesh and juiciness. There is something deeply zesty at the core that makes this utterly moreish and so fresh."
Sonsierra 2015 Crianza  (Rioja),Sonsierra,Red,Crianza,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$20,88,Michael Schachner,"Ripeness is conveyed through mild raisin and prune aromas. While this is firm on the palate, there's just enough cushion to provide depth. Earthy berry and raisin flavors reflect a warm year, while this is sappy on a fruity finish with just enough edge to it."
Siduri 2006 Parsons' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Siduri,Red,Parsons' Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$45,89,,"Spicy and very ripe, this polished Pinot bursts with pie-filling cherry and currant flavors, with interesting notes of tangerine rind, clove and orange pekoe tea.

This is a plump, modern and well-extracted wine with soft tannins and beautiful length."
Dunstan 2017 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),Dunstan,White,Durell Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",13.7%,$50,91,Virginie Boone,"Opening with a crisp, stony nose of mineral and brine, this wine is also floral and earthy, with demure fruit. From the famous vineyard, it offers classic flavors of apple, pear and nutmeg, wrapped within complementary oak."
Toogood 2005 Cabernet Franc (El Dorado),Toogood,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.6%,$30,89,,"This is a big red wine that packs a whallop. It has the majestic rusticity of Petite Sirah, yet with a Bordeauxesque nobility that makes it elegant. With a briary taste of blackberries, black currants, mocha, pepper and violets, it might gain a little complexity with a few years in the cellar."
Barone di Villagrande 2015 Salina Bianco White (Terre Siciliane),Barone di Villagrande,White,Salina Bianco,White Blend,"Terre Siciliane, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",,,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"A blend of native grapes Rucignola, Catarratto and Malvasia, this has aromas suggesting pressed yellow flower and dried herb. The palate is somewhat lean, offering citrus, dried Mediterranean herb and a hint of nut."
Idrias 2007 Sevil Red (Somontano),Idrias,Red,Sevil,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Somontano, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$40,83,Michael Schachner,"Stony minerality blends with raisin, leather and leafy berry aromas. This offers cheek-stanching citric acidity but not enough body to absorb it. Flavors of herbal red plum are choppy and turn gritty and fiery on the finish."
Calcu 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley),Calcu,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",13%,$14,85,Michael Schachner,"Gaseous aromas settle on saline, chlorine and gritty citrus. This is round and not overly acidic in feel, with pickled, briny, green-leaning flavors of lime, cucumber and bell pepper."

Heinz Schmitt 2004 Halbtrocken Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),Heinz Schmitt,White,Halbtrocken,Riesling,"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, Germany",12%,$13,86,Joe Czerwinski,"Seems a bit too big and bulky in the mouth, with a touch of warmth on the finish, but has plenty of pluses as well, showing more minerality and complexity than many wines in this price range. Hints of honey, petrol and smoke intertwine with melon and pineapple fruit. Imported by Magellan Wine Imports."
WillaKenzie Estate 1998 Pinot Meunier (Oregon),WillaKenzie Estate,Red,,"Pinot Meunier, Other Red","Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",,$20,88,Jesica Vargas,"Rarely seen as a varietal wine, this Pinot Meunier is reminiscent of a sturdy, earthy Pinot Noir. The same pie-cherry and chocolate flavors are there, nicely scented with new oak, but the acids are a bit higher, and the finish tightens up. A great wine for salmon."
Rocca delle Macìe 2010 Riserva di Fizzano  (Chianti Classico),Rocca delle Macìe,Red,Riserva di Fizzano,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$30,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Underbrush, spice and plum aromas lead the nose on this blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot. The smooth palate delivers a core of juicy black cherry accented with licorice and espresso. Polished and round, this is already drinking well, but can age at least a few more years."
William Knuttel 2008 Basor Terrace Vineyard Pinot Gris (Sonoma County),William Knuttel,White,Basor Terrace Vineyard,,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",13.9%,$17,86,,"A rich, elaborate Pinot Gris, with strong, ripe tangerine, white peach, honey and sweet, oaky vanilla flavors. There's good acidity, but the finish is so sweet, it's almost like a dessert wine."

Duncan Peak 2003 Petite Sirah (Mendocino County),Duncan Peak,Red,,Petite Sirah,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",14.9%,$25,90,,"There are structural similarities here with Napa Cabernet. The wine is dry, lush in tannins, balanced in acidity, with ripe but controlled black currant and cherry flavors. Yes, there's a certain briary, wild character, but this is really one heck of a good wine. Drink now through 2009 for its youthful fruit."
Quinta do Vale Meão 2017 Monte Meão Casa das Máquinas Red (Douro),Quinta do Vale Meão,Red,Monte Meão Casa das Máquinas,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",13.5%,$49,94,Roger Voss,"This single-vineyard wine is one of a series from this major estate. It is a blend of Touriga Franca and Tinta Barocca. It's rich and spicy from wood aging, while also impressively balanced. The still-young black fruits are set to allow it to age comfortably. Drink from 2023."
Nittardi 2012 Belcanto  (Chianti Classico),Nittardi,Red,Belcanto,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",13%,$23,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of toast, coffee, ripe plum and caramel lead the nose of this Sangiovese-based wine. On the palate, espresso and dark chocolate notes back up dried black cherry while firm tannins provide the framework. It's a bit shy on fruit richness so drink soon."
Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2005 Les Jalets  (Crozes-Hermitage),Paul Jaboulet Aîné,Red,Les Jalets,,"Crozes-Hermitage, Rhône Valley, France",12.5%,$23,87,Joe Czerwinski,"The most accessible of Paul Jaboulet Aîné's Crozes cuvées, the 2005 Les Jalets offers smoky, herbal, peppery aromatics, crisp pomegranate fruit and silky   tannins on the finish. It's a solid introduction to Crozes-Hermitage in an early-maturing style."
3 Stones 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),3 Stones,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Marlborough, New Zealand",12.5%,$15,90,Joe Czerwinski,"Richly fruited and tropical, this is a medium-bodied, slightly creamy-textured Marlborough Savvy. Flavors hint at pineapple, honey and stone fruit, yet remain zesty and clean, with a refreshing citrus zing to the finish. Stock up for the summer."
Testarossa 2012 Dos Rubios Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Testarossa,Red,Dos Rubios Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$61,92,Matt Kettmann,"Rich blackberry fruit gets aromatic lift from violet and sagebrush in this wine from a relatively new vineyard, planted in 2008. That spice and fruit tension works well on the palate too, with ripe pluot and wild berries accompanied by black licorice, black olive and roast beef."
MontGras 2009 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),MontGras,White,Reserva,Sauvignon Blanc,"San Antonio, Chile",13.5%,$12,84,Michael Schachner,"Smells basic and clean, with touches of apple and green veggies.

The palate continues in the same creamy fashion but adds juicy Mirabelle and ripe lemon that edges all these notions with ripeness and clarity. Yes, this is generous and rounded, but its contours are defined and there is not an ounce of fat. Drink 2025–2040."
Roederer Estate 2003 L'Ermitage Brut Rosé Sparkling (Anderson Valley),Roederer Estate,Sparkling,L'Ermitage Brut Rosé,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",12%,VivinoGary's Wine,94,,"This is as fine a rosé sparkling wine as has ever been produced in California. Almost 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it has rich flavors of cherries, raspberries, vanilla, toast and creamy lees, in the style of Champagne, and is completely dry and very crisp in acidity. Fabulously drinkable now, it should develop well over the next 6–8 years."
Ricardo Santos 2016 Semillon (Mendoza),Ricardo Santos,White,,"Sémillon, Sémillon","Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$16,88,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of butterscotch, vanilla and melony fruits rest comfortably in front of a smooth palate.

Vignobles Pelvillain 2018 Domaine du Théron  (Cahors),Vignobles Pelvillain,Red,Domaine du Théron,Malbec,"Cahors, Southwest France, France",13.5%,$16,87,Roger Voss,"This soft, ripe and fruity wine offers a bright blend of acidity and black-currant flavors.

Sullivan,"Like many wines from this vintage, this one packs a fruit-filled wallop. Toast, coffee and blueberry aromas give way to ripe, plush plum flavors that bring a sense of seamlessness. It's a whole lot of wine for the money."
Framingham 2014 Ribbonwood Pinot Noir (Marlborough),Framingham,Red,Ribbonwood,Pinot Noir,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13%,$20,85,Joe Czerwinski,"This is a supple, medium-bodied Pinot Noir that exemplifies much of what is coming out of Marlborough.

Davies 2016 JD Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),Davies,Red,JD Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Diamond Mountain District, Napa, California, US",14.1%,$70,93,Virginie Boone,"This elegant, classically styled wine is earthy in tobacco, mushroom and fig, a lovely wine from the mountain appellation. A soft understated richness of plum and black cherry wrap around a texture of grippy dust and dark chocolate, finishing as gracefully as it starts."
El Pensador 2009 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),El Pensador,White,,"Verdejo, Spanish White","Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León, Northern Spain, Spain",12%,$17,86,Michael Schachner,"A solid rendition of Verdejo with apple and pear aromas along with basic minerality. The palate is standard and firm, with good acidity pushing apple and citrus flavors. Perfectly competent but not showing the nuances and higher qualities that would justify a $17 outlay."
Quinta de la Rosa 2011 DouRosa Red (Douro),Quinta de la Rosa,Red,DouRosa,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",14.5%,,88,Roger Voss,"A spicy, ripe wine that is part of the second line from Quinta de la Rosa.

Roccafiore 2008 Rosso Sangiovese (Umbria),Roccafiore,Red,Rosso,Sangiovese,"Umbria, Central Italy, Italy",14%,$16,87,,"This Sangiovese-based red has a light, ruby color and offers fresh aromas of violet, wet earth, wild mushroom and leather. Delicate and streamlined, it has fresh acidity that would pair well with simple pasta and Parmigiano."
Markko 2012 Select Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Ohio),Markko,Red,Select Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Ohio, Ohio, US",11.5%,$39,86,Fiona Adams,"Savory aromas of baked raspberry, cranberry and vanilla are somewhat foxy.

It makes you wonder why we obsess with single-vineyard bottlings. Unfined and unfiltered, it's rich and pure in blackberries, currants, mocha, anise and new French oak, with superb tannins. Will age effortlessly through at least 2021."
Ca' Momi 2007 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Ca' Momi,Red,,Zinfandel,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.9%,$15,82,,"Simple and jammy, with sweet flavors of cherries, currants, licorice and spices."

The palate introduces bright lemon vigor that cuts right through to hit all the pleasure centers of the brain with freshness. This is alive and shimmers with tangerine and lemon. Inherent acidic drive makes for a thrilling, dry finish."
Michel Picard 2009  Bourgogne,Michel Picard,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Bourgogne, Burgundy, France",13%,$18,84,Roger Voss,"This wine balances its acidity, light texture and softness with ripe red fruits. It has a touch of bitterness, although this is enveloped by the ripe fruit of the vintage."
Cave de Ribeauvillé 2010 Clos du Zahnacker White (Alsace),Cave de Ribeauvillé,White,Clos du Zahnacker,"Alsace white blend, White Blend","Alsace, Alsace, France",14.5%,,90,Roger Voss,"From a parcel in the Osterberg Grand Cru vineyard, this is a blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewurztraminer. The spice dominates although it is cut through by Riesling acidity. It's not quite integrated, showing youthful exuberance that needs to settle down. Drink from 2016."
Filus 2007 Alto Medrano Vineyards Malbec (Mendoza),Filus,Red,Alto Medrano Vineyards,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.6%,$13,86,Michael Schachner,"Big, grapey and whole on the nose, and then lound, large and ripe in the mouth, with ringing acidity, bold berry flavors and a warm, oily, earthy finish.

If it does have the fresh black currant characteristic of the vintage, it is possible that it is verging on drying out. The wine should be drunk now."
Carol Shelton 2015 Coquille Blanc White (Paso Robles),Carol Shelton,White,Coquille Blanc,Rhône-style White Blend,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",13.2%,$24,88,Matt Kettmann,"Dried apple, pear and fresh honeysuckle scents show on the floral and fruity nose of this blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier.

Kooyong 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula),Kooyong,Red,Estate,Pinot Noir,"Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, Australia",13.5%,$55,93,Joe Czerwinski,"Like many Mornington producers, Kooyong has a relatively short track record (founded 1996). For much of that time, winemaking was under the guidance of Sandro Mosele, including this stunning 2012. It shows Burgundian levels of complexity in its array of smoke, leather, root vegetable and black cherry notes, then backs that all up with a firm-yet-supple texture and tremendous length. Drink now through 2022."
Maysara 2002 Estate Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Maysara,Red,Estate Cuvée,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,Wine.comVivino,90,Paul Gregutt,"From a blend of very low-cropped pinot clones, this expressively fruity wine jumps with strawberry, raspberry, cherry and plum fruits, hints of mineral and a tight streak of tannic beetroot.

Santa Florentina 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Famatina Valley),Santa Florentina,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Famatina Valley, Other, Argentina",13%,$8,82,Michael Schachner,"Incredibly candied and sweet smelling, much like cotton candy or pink marshmallows. The palate has a cloying, sticky mouthfeel and flavors of raisin, milk chocolate and herbal, tart berry fruits. Creamy and carob-like on the finish. Tastes and smells affected."

Coelho 2018 Coelho Vineyard Chardonnay (Van Duzer Corridor),Coelho,White,Coelho Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Van Duzer Corridor, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",12.5%,$35,92,Paul Gregutt,"Made using the black Chardonnay method that is intentionally hyper-oxidized prior to fermenting, this wine is crisp in snappy apple and persimmon fruit. It was aged 14 months in half new French oak, softening the mouthfeel and adding pleasant notes of toast and butter."
Domaine les Cantates 2012 Jacquère (Chignin),Domaine les Cantates,White,,"Jacquère, Other White","Chignin, France Other, France",12%,$20,87,Roger Voss,"Light, bright and fruity, this is a delicious glass of wine.

Venteux 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Venteux,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.9%,$48,92,,"Soft and luscious, with a sweet peppermint patty taste firming up the blackberries, currants, pepper and cedar flavors. Shows real discernment and class. Drink in the next five years."
Arnaldo Rivera 2014 Undicicomuni  (Barolo),Arnaldo Rivera,Red,Undicicomuni,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$38,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Red-berry, tilled soil and leather aromas shape the nose. The linear palate offers red cherry, cinnamon and a licorice note alongside firm, polished tannins. Drink 2021–2029."
Anemoi 2014 Notus Red (Grand Valley),Anemoi,Red,Notus,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Grand Valley, Colorado, US",13.5%,$50,89,Fiona Adams,"Black currant and blackberry are plush on the palate with aromas and flavors of anise, vanilla bean and pepper. Firm tannin and long spicy finish are smooth and food friendly."
Nicolas Feuillatte NV Brut Kosher Mevushal  (Champagne),Nicolas Feuillatte,Sparkling,Brut Kosher Mevushal,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$40,85,,"Bizarre is the best way to describe this kosher offering: The nose is fragrant, with bright ripe fruit backed by cotton-candy and algae-ish notes.  Apple, charcoal and pear are tinged with a slight greenness on the palate; mouthful is medium-full, but a bit too effervescent and frothy. Finishes long."
Maison Champy 2015 Les Folatières Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),Maison Champy,White,Les Folatières Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Puligny-Montrachet, Burgundy, France",13.5%,,93,Roger Voss,"Packed with mature fruit, this is a ripe wine from one of the top premier cru vineyards in Puligny-Montrachet. It has a delicious, full and creamy texture that's cut with lemony acidity. Toast from oak aging is still present and will soften as the wine ages further. With its mineral aftertaste, it will need time. Drink from 2021."
Château Mangot 2016  Saint-Émilion,Château Mangot,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",14%,$35,92,Roger Voss,"Now almost mature, this richly textured wine is powered by dark tannins that sit comfortably with the black plum and berry fruits. The majority Merlot in the blend gives the wine weight and ripeness that are happily balanced by final juicy acidity. Drink from 2021."
Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2015 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),Thirsty Owl Wine Company,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12.8%,$18,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Lavish violet perfume introduces this demure yet luminous Pinot Noir. Crisp black cherry and berry flavors are full of tartness and vibe, yet edged by soft tones of toast and earth, along with a fine frame of tannins. The finish meanders beautifully. It's ready to drink now but should continue to drink well until at least 2023."
Jean Becker 2012 Froehn Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Jean Becker,White,Froehn Grand Cru,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,,91,Roger Voss,"A steely, crisp and mineral Riesling from the Froehn vineyard in Zellenberg. Great potential awaits in its tight aromatic fruits and zesty acidity. It offers structure, flavors of citrus and white currants from the organic grapes and a texture that demands aging. Drink from 2017."
Chapel Hill 2014 The Parson Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Chapel Hill,Red,The Parson,,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$20,91,Joe Czerwinski,"Blackberry (or perhaps mulberry) leads the way in this plush wine. Hints of black licorice and cracked pepper add nuance to the palate, while the finish is warm and supple."
Innocenti 2018  Rosso di Montalcino,Innocenti,Red,,Sangiovese,"Rosso di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$35,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Underbrush, moist earth, toasted nut and a whiff of violet form the nose. Light bodied and linear, the palate offers cranberry, Marasca cherry and star anise alongside bright acidity and dusty, not very persistent tannins."
Hugl-Wimmer 2019 Gemischter Satz by Martin White (Niederösterreich),Hugl-Wimmer,White,Gemischter Satz by Martin,"Austrian white blend, White Blend","Niederösterreich, Austria",12.5%,$16,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Lemon and lemon balm send aromatic freshness from the glass. The palate also shimmers with green notes reminiscent of moss, boxwood and blossom, all surrounded by lightness, slight spritz and lemony freshness. This is easy but oh so fresh and makes a cracking, light summer wine."
Te Kairanga 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Martinborough),Te Kairanga,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Martinborough, New Zealand",,$14,93,,"Unusually lush, even for this vintage, it starts with pronounced aromas of limes and lemons, fresh green apples, and juniper berries, and turns luscious in the mouth. Partial barrel fermentation and lees aging create a creamy, smoky mouthfeel, while the fruity flavors are volcanic. But it's dry and elegant. Virtually flawness Sauvignon Blanc."
Domaine Santa Duc 2019 Les Quatres Terres Red (Côtes du Rhône),Domaine Santa Duc,Red,Les Quatres Terres,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Côtes du Rhône, Rhône Valley, France",14.5%,$20,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This wine incorporates grapes from the elite Cru appellations of Vacqueyras and Rasteau as well as Côtes-du-Rhône Villages sites in Roaix and Séguret. A piercing blackberry and bramble-scented blend of Grenache and Syrah sourced from limestone soils, it's an approachably fruity introduction to Santa Duc's majestic (and more expensive wines) but maintains a trademark vitality and finesse. Highlighting juicy cassis and plum flavors along with a zippy mineral finish, it's a delicately tannic red that should drink well through 2026."
L'Angolo 2015 Reserve Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),L'Angolo,Red,Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$71,89,Paul Gregutt,"A difficult wine to analyze, this at first seems dilute. With ample breathing, it fills in and spreads out, showing mineral notes and raspberry and pomegranate fruit. The astringent, tongue-drying finish calls for pairing with a hearty, meaty entrée."
Château Nozières 2012 Ambroise de l'Her  (Cahors),Château Nozières,Red,Ambroise de l'Her,Malbec,"Cahors, Southwest France, France",13.5%,,91,Roger Voss,"Still very firm and dry, this is a structured wood-aged wine with a good aging potential. As it opens up, juicy black plum flavors show strongly alongside the dark tannins and perfumed acidity. It's a powerful, dense wine that needs to age. Drink from 2017."
Ego Bodegas 2017 Fuerza Red (Jumilla),Ego Bodegas,Red,Fuerza,,"Jumilla, Levante, Spain",14.5%,$22,90,Michael Schachner,"Black fruit aromas dominate the dark nose and carry to the tightly packed palate. Flavors of spiced berries and toast are the main focus for this blend of Monastrell and Cabernet, enjoyable for those who seek out riper, oaked offerings."
Redmon 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Redmon,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$49,93,,"Tough and gritty, with hard tannins, this is definitely astringent and dry, but it does show classic Napa character. Blended with Cabernet Franc and Merlot, it's rich in blackberry, black cherry, currant and dark chocolate flavors that finish long. It would be a mistake to drink this wine too young. Cellar it until 2018, and it should provide mature beauty well beyond."
Caruso & Minini 2006 Terre di Giumara Syrah (Sicilia),Caruso & Minini,Red,Terre di Giumara,,"Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",14%,$14,88,,"Here's a Syrah with bursting aromas of mature blueberry, cherry, spice and smoked bacon. The wine is full, round and generous with a supple feel and soft concentration. Pair it with lamb or roasted pork."
Lynmar 2012 Quail Hill Vineyard Block 10 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Lynmar,Red,Quail Hill Vineyard Block 10,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.8%,$70,91,Virginie Boone,"Block 10 was made with 25% whole cluster fermentation, the result bold and impressive in cola cherry and soft baking spices, an intriguing floral note akin to geranium or gardenia highlighting the palate. Midway, expect an expansive opening of the wine, before notes of cocoa and espresso delve in."
Viña Arnáiz 2010 Gran Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),Viña Arnáiz,Red,Gran Reserva,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",14.5%,$43,84,Michael Schachner,"While this isn't terrible, for a gran reserva from a vaunted vintage it leaves much to be desired. A stalky nose is briary at best and mulchy at worst. A tannic, raw and rubbing palate deals herbal berry and oak flavors, while the finish is woody and not fruity."
Emmerich Knoll 2006 Ried Kreutles Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),Emmerich Knoll,White,Ried Kreutles Smaragd,Grüner Veltliner,"Wachau, Austria",,$40,89,Roger Voss,"A rich wine, touched by tropical fruit, pepper and light acidity. Although there is crispness, this wine is more about roundness, allied with weight, but finishing with fresh spiced pear flavors."
Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2013 Proprietor's Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Chateau Lafayette Reneau,White,Proprietor's Reserve Barrel Fermented,Chardonnay,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12.5%,$20,86,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Orange blossom and acacia perfume this very pretty, spry wine. Tart green apple and pear flavors are straightforward yet refreshing on the palate, finishing briskly on a zesty lemon-lime note."
Château de Gaudou NV Gaudou Exception Brut Malbec (Vin Mousseux),Château de Gaudou,Sparkling,Gaudou Exception Brut,Malbec,"Vin Mousseux, France Other, France",11%,$19,86,Roger Voss,"A Blanc de Noirs from Malbec, this aromatic wine has just a hint of tannins from the grape skins along with attractive acidity. It's a surprisingly fresh and fruity wine in the context of Malbec. Drink now."
Jaume Serra 2015 Brut Nature Reserva Método Tradicional Sparkling (Cava),Jaume Serra,Sparkling,Brut Nature Reserva Método Tradicional,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Cava, Catalonia, Spain",11.5%,$16,89,Michael Schachner,"White fruit and pineapple aromas are a touch briny. On the palate, this is round and pulpy without much bubble action or scour. Dry, salty lemon-lime flavors finish well. Known for its value Cristalino label, this is a step up for Jaume Serra."
Minassian-Young 2008 Estate Zinfandel (Paso Robles),Minassian-Young,Red,Estate,Zinfandel,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15.4%,$24,81,,"Tastes unevenly ripened, with blackberry and vegetal flavors side by side, and seems to have residual sugar. The sweetness is compounded with high alcohol."
Tahbilk 1996 1860 Vines Shiraz (Nagambie Lakes),Tahbilk,Red,1860 Vines,,"Nagambie Lakes, Victoria, Australia",13%,$125,92,,"This is a wine that feels old-fashioned but still not ready to drink. It smells nutty and dusty, with black pepper and anise accents. Its plum fruit core is wound very tightly, and encased in a fair amount of good-quality oak. Tannins are thick and wooly, so much so that I'd forget that I even had this in the cellar until Bush is out of office, then drink through 2014 or so. Imported by Broadbent Selections, Inc."
Cantina Miglianico 2017 Pietra Majella  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),Cantina Miglianico,Red,Pietra Majella,"Montepulciano, Italian Red","Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Central Italy, Italy",13%,$21,88,Alexander Peartree,"There's a pleasing depth to the aromas of brandy-soaked cherry, allspice and tobacco on the nose. It's rounded in feel, with soft tannins and juicy fruit flavors that show a delicate accent of warm spices."
Vega Sauco 2002 Roble  (Toro),Vega Sauco,Red,Roble,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toro, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$10,86,Michael Schachner,"Starts with dusty cherry, plum and green herb aromas before turning more smoky and saucy. Warm and solid, with flavors of plum, vanilla and spice. Well constructed and balanced, if not overly exciting. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain."
Ernie Els 2008 Signature Red (Stellenbosch),Ernie Els,Red,Signature,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",15%,$95,92,Lauren Buzzeo,"This is a dark, dense and brooding Bordeaux-style blend, comprised of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot, 5% Malbec and 5% Cabernet Franc. Notes of cocoa, cigar tobacco and leather jazz up the black-fruit core of cassis, black plum and berry. The palate is full and gripping, with firm tannins that hang on tightly through the long and slightly smoky finish. Drink after decanting now, or enjoy through 2018."
Château de Santenay 2015 Les Brunettes et Planchots  (Aloxe-Corton),Château de Santenay,Red,Les Brunettes et Planchots,Pinot Noir,"Aloxe-Corton, Burgundy, France",13%,$65,90,Roger Voss,"Vines at the base of the famed Corton grand cru hill produce this rich attractively fruity wine. Bold and with warm tannins and light wood-aging flavors, the wine is generous and full of red-berry fruits. It also has a more serious side as witnessed by the tannins. Drink from 2019."
Quinta Vale Dona Maria 2013 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),Quinta Vale Dona Maria,Port/Sherry,Late Bottled Vintage,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",19.5%,$22,91,Roger Voss,"Bottled unfiltered, this wine has definite aging potential. It is perfumed and structured with ripe tannins as well as red fruits. It is a dry style of Port, bringing out fruit as well as structure and acidity. The tannins will allow the wine to age. Drink now, but better from 2021."
Clos des Bachelards 2010  Fleurie,Clos des Bachelards,Red,,Gamay,"Fleurie, Beaujolais, France",12%,$24,89,Roger Voss,"A very perfumed wine, almost heady, with its herbal and wild flower aromas. The wine is still closed up, darkly tannic and very firm. At the same time, black fruits show the same perfumed character. This is very flavorful and structured. Drink this unusual wine from 2014."
Château Gréteau Médeville 2012  Bordeaux Blanc,Château Gréteau Médeville,White,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Bordeaux Blanc, Bordeaux, France",,,86,Roger Voss,"Tight and herbaceous, this is a very Sauvignon-oriented wine. It has the classic, intensely grassy feel, a tangy lemon texture and green acidity. It is very intense and concentrated."
Agricosimo 2017 Natura &amp; Passione Pecorino (Colline Teatine),Agricosimo,White,Natura & Passione,"Pecorino, Italian White","Colline Teatine, Central Italy, Italy",13.5%,$14,86,Alexander Peartree,"There's a strong chemical and plastic aroma on the nose of this wine, which eventually blows off to reveal more classic Pecorino aromas of chamomile and melon. It has a waxy texture that carries rich fruit and floral flavors, with proper acidity to match."
Luigi Baudana 2006 Donatella  (Barbera d'Alba),Luigi Baudana,Red,Donatella,Barbera,"Barbera d'Alba, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$30,88,,"Black cherry, chocolate and menthol accents color the nose of this ripe and plump Barbera d'Alba. The wine is firm and generous in the mouth with a chewy, slightly sweet finish. It sees one year of oak for extra spice on the close."
Quintodecimo 2016 Via del Campo Falanghina (Irpinia),Quintodecimo,White,Via del Campo,"Falanghina, Italian White","Irpinia, Southern Italy, Italy",13.5%,$50,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Packaged in an extremely heavy bottle, this offers subtle aromas of banana, pineapple, wild herb and a whiff of toast. The aromas follow over to the rounded palate along with a hint of bitter almond while a saline note marks the finish."
Erasmo 2012 Late Harvest Torontel (Maule Valley),Erasmo,Dessert,Late Harvest,"Torontel, Other White","Maule Valley, Chile",12.5%,$44,93,Michael Schachner,"A burnished gold color and rich honeyed aromas open this dessert Torontel with Old World shadings. A balanced palate suggests lateharvest Pinot Gris from Alsace, while flavors of honey, caramel and toffee finish with a pecan note. Drink through 2028."
Bodegas Escorihuela 2003 High Altitude Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec (Agrelo),Bodegas Escorihuela,Red,High Altitude,"Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Agrelo, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$10,86,Michael Schachner,"Purple in color, with potent berry aromas. The blend is 65% in favor of Malbec, and the wine boasts black raspberry and plum flavors. Finishes hefty and warm, with notes of cola."
Martin Ranch 2018 Therese Vineyards Grenache Blanc (Arroyo Seco),Martin Ranch,White,Therese Vineyards,"Grenache Blanc, Other White","Arroyo Seco, Central Coast, California, US",15.3%,$32,90,Matt Kettmann,"A bright splash of lemon and crisp pear flesh kick off the nose on this fresh bottling. There's a hit of wax at the tip of the sip, which then offers zesty citrus flavors and plenty of palate-cleansing acidity."
Viña Andrico 2014 Gran Reserva Malbec (Uco Valley),Viña Andrico,Red,Gran Reserva,Malbec,"Uco Valley, Mendoza Province, Argentina",15.2%,$60,92,Michael Schachner,"A pitch-black color and ripe aromas of cassis, raisin, vanilla and cocoa set up a lush palate that's made less jammy by tartaric acidity. Vanilla, mocha and blackberry flavors finish with more of the same before settling on prune, cassis and creamy oak."
Kirkland Signature 2007 Grandmère Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County),Kirkland Signature,Red,Grandmère Old Vine,Zinfandel,"Amador County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",15.5%,$12,87,,"A bit overripe and hot in alcohol. That's the price of getting such rich fruit flavors. Dark chocolate, blackberry preserves, red currants, black raspberries and spicy satsuma flood the mouth, leading to a super-spicy finish."
Varner 2001 Home Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),Varner,White,Home Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Santa Cruz Mountains, Central Coast, California, US",,$34,90,,"Oakier, leesier and riper than Varner's two other Chards, but not superior, because the wine loses balance. Charry, smoky oak dominates the fruit from entry to finish."
Lammershoek 2001 Barrique Chenin Blanc (Coastal Region),Lammershoek,White,Barrique,Chenin Blanc,"$10,Buy Now",14.5%,$10,87,,"Austrians Paul and Anna Kretzel co-own this winery with the Stephan family from Germany. The best fruit from their 600-ton production launches a fleet of proprietary wines. This flagship white is barrel- fermented in French oak, which produces a strong whiff of buttered wheat toast at the start. The flavors of dried pineapple, sweet basil and white pepper are supported by good acidity. Try this with a summery fruit salad."
Aresti 2009 Estate Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),Aresti,White,Estate Selection,Sauvignon Blanc,"Curicó Valley, Chile",13%,$11,84,Michael Schachner,"Tropical on the nose, with aromas of pineapple, mango and lychee. The palate is plump and highly regular, and the flavors of green banana and pithy orange and citrus are not much to ponder. Perfectly drinkable if well chilled, but it's not bringing a lot to the table."
Viña Cobos 2015 Bramare Marchiori Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Perdriel),Viña Cobos,Red,Bramare Marchiori Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Perdriel, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.5%,$100,93,Michael Schachner,"Ultraripe aromas of raisin, oud wood and musky men's cologne are attractive and complex for a young Cabernet that's putting out at max level in terms of lushness and extraction. Deep oaky blackberry and chocolate flavors hold onto a café-mocha note on a full finish. Drink through 2024."
Grandes Serres 2017 Carius Red (Cairanne),Grandes Serres,Red,Carius,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Cairanne, Rhône Valley, France",,,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,Primary black-cherry and berry aromas abound in this approachably fruit-forward wine. Appreciate this uncomplicated but juicy sip for its buoyant fruit character.
Domaine Maby 2017 La Fermade White (Lirac),Domaine Maby,White,La Fermade,Rhône-style White Blend,"Lirac, Rhône Valley, France",14%,$20,89,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Initial notes of dried herbs and earth freshen with aeration, exposing pristine notes of apricot and pear. The palate is silky and supple, anchored by a grip of grapefruit pith on the finish. This rich, voluminous wine is ready now but should hold through 2021."
Hess 2008 Allomi Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Hess,Red,Allomi,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.4%,$28,85,,"Oak dominates this wine, giving it toast and vanilla caramel aromas and flavors. The underlying wine is soft and fruity, with blackberries and cherries. Drink now. Production was 24,146 cases."
Ernesto Catena 2014 Padrillos Malbec (Mendoza),Ernesto Catena,Red,Padrillos,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$12,80,Michael Schachner,"Soapy, floral aromas are more like those of a scented candle than most Malbecs. Next is an astringent, raw palate with sketchy plum flavors and bitterness to the finish. This doesn't taste convincingly natural."
Domeniul Bogdan 2019 Cuvée Experience White (Murfatlar),Domeniul Bogdan,White,Cuvée Experience,White Blend,"Murfatlar, Romania",13.5%,$24,87,Jeff Jenssen,"This Romanian white blend is straw colored with aromas of hickory smoke, lemon and grapefruit zest. The well balanced palate offers flavors of grapefruit and lemon zest before the crisp, clean finish."
Offley NV 10-year old tawny  (Port),Offley,Port/Sherry,10-year old tawny,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",,$26,86,Roger Voss,"A very sweet style, with flavors of Hershey bars, figs, vanilla and caramel. Rather out of balance."
Geyser Peak 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),Geyser Peak,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",13%,$17,90,,"Always rock-solid and fairly priced, Geyser Peak's Cab this year is well-structured and firm, with sturdy tannins and bright acidity. It will need a year or so for the blackcurrant and plum flavors to emerge. There's a rich earthy streak that makes this a fine companion with food."
Matuba 2006 Premium Select Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),Matuba,White,Premium Select,Sauvignon Blanc,"Western Cape, South Africa",13%,$15,84,Susan Kostrzewa,"Soft and subtle tropical fruit aromas are anchored by some spice on the nose of this pleasing but straightforward wine from Matuba. There's pineapple, lemon and grapefruit on the palate, and the finish is clean and refreshing. Imported by American Wine Distributors, Inc."
Quinta do Carneiro 2008 Pactus Touriga Nacional (Lisboa),Quinta do Carneiro,Red,Pactus,"Touriga Nacional, Portuguese Red","Lisboa, Portugal",14%,$13,85,Roger Voss,"Earthy wine that has rich, chewy fruit, its tannins a serious element. There is weight as well, the wine ripe, full, with juicy plum flavors."
Pievalta 2017  Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore,Pievalta,White,,"Verdicchio, Italian White","Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore, Central Italy, Italy",13%,$19,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made with grapes grown according to the principles of biodynamic farming, this fragrant white opens with heady scents of yellow flower, tropical fruit and a whiff of acacia honey. Round and savory, the polished, delicious palate delivers ripe yellow peach, citrus, almond and white almond."
Mahoney 2009 Las Brisas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),Mahoney,Red,Las Brisas Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$36,87,,"A tight, dry and somewhat one-dimensional Pinot Noir. It offers cherry, cola and spice flavors, and is elegantly structured. Grows more interesting as it warms in the glass, but it's ready for drinking now."
Doudet Naudin NV Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),Doudet Naudin,Sparkling,Brut,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Crémant de Bourgogne, Burgundy, France",12%,$33,90,Roger Voss,"A refreshing, crisp blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and bright, tight Aligoté, this wine is light and fruity. Bursting with apple flavor, it is ready to drink now."
Pavlidis 2008 Thema Red (Drama),Pavlidis,Red,Thema,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Drama, Greece",14%,$30,86,Susan Kostrzewa,"Anise, blackberry, black pepper and savory spice aromas lead this ripe red from Pavlidis. The palate is laced with a vanilla note, and the red berry flavors are rich and easy to like. With its good spice and complex fruit, this should pair well with grilled meats and tomato pastas."
Tenuta Cavalier Pepe 2016 Bianco di Bellona Coda di Volpe (Irpinia),Tenuta Cavalier Pepe,White,Bianco di Bellona,"Coda di Volpe, Italian White","Irpinia, Southern Italy, Italy",13%,$12,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Linear and bright, this has delicate aromas of pineapple and yellow stone fruit that follow over to the palate. Fresh acidity gives it a clean finish."
Failla 2011 Estate Vineyard Syrah (Fort Ross-Seaview),Failla,Red,Estate Vineyard,,"Fort Ross-Seaview, Sonoma, California, US",13.8%,$62,90,,"Failla's 2011 Syrah is strikingly brisk with acidity, but has a tannic smoothness that makes it velvety in the mouth. Complex flavors of blackberry, blueberry, roasted meat, mushroom, black pepper, balsam and cedar are layered and bright. It's harder and leaner in style than Failla's best vintages, but nonetheless elegant. Drink now–2014."
J. Lohr 2019 Riverstone Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),J. Lohr,White,Riverstone,Chardonnay,"Arroyo Seco, Central Coast, California, US",13.9%,$14,90,Matt Kettmann,"Opulent aromas of ripe pear, gardenia, apple and coconut show on the nose of this bottling. It's racy with acidity on the sip, where a tart lemon flavor leads into apple blossom, poached pear and pineapple, with a slight butter tone on the finish."
Division 2019 Un Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Division,Red,Un,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.6%,$28,91,Paul Gregutt,"Strawberry and cherry fruit combines here with a pie-filling consistency. A mix of grapes from six different vineyards, it comes into focus as a seamless and complete fruit-forward wine. Tannins are moderate but provide enough back-end texture to boost the overall power."
Lovingston 2016 Janet's Block Chardonnay (Monticello),Lovingston,White,Janet's Block,Chardonnay,"Monticello, Virginia, US",13.5%,$22,85,Carrie Dykes,"A fairly dark shade of rusty gold in the glass, this bottling starts with aromas of toasted nuts and baked bread. The palate comes across more fresh, showing tangy lemon rind, unsweetened iced tea and more nutty qualities."
Bell 2007 Canterbury Vineyard Syrah (Sierra Foothills),Bell,Red,Canterbury Vineyard,,"Sierra Foothills, Sierra Foothills, California, US",,$26,86,,"Soft in the mouth, with a somewhat simple structure, this Syrah's main virtue is flavor. It's enormously rich in ripe blackberry- and cherry-pie filling, cola, licorice, mint, chocolate, bacon and pepper flavors, and is fully dry."
Egeo 2017 Verdejo (Rueda),Egeo,White,,"Verdejo, Spanish White","Rueda, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$15,87,Michael Schachner,"Simple peach and melon aromas are chunky. Strong acidity cuts through an otherwise plump and melony palate. Short, basic green melon and white pepper flavors lose fruit but not their appeal on the finish."
Nicholas Cole Cellars 2005 Michele Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Nicholas Cole Cellars,Red,Michele Red Wine,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$55,90,Paul Gregutt,"Very ripe flavors of berries and figs dominate this Cab-centric Bordeaux blend, along with intriguing side notes suggesting melon and cassis, smoke and mocha. It's a big, sexy wine, its fruit flavors backed with thick, ripe, but chalky tannins. If there is a downside, it is that it comes off as a bit monolithic."
Masút 2013 Haiku Vineyard Chardonnay (Mendocino County),Masút,White,Haiku Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",14.3%,$40,91,Jim Gordon,"Bold aromas and generous but sophisticated flavors shape a rich tasting experience in this full-bodied, buttery wine. Aromas resemble nutmeg and ripe pear, while the flavors are like lively green apple. The texture is both smooth and crisp at the same time, and the long finish denotes quality."
Good Earth Wine 2008 Concerto Collection Basso Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Nashik),Good Earth Wine,Red,Concerto Collection Basso Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,,14%,$20,82,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Charred wood and smoke dominate the nose and palate of this Indian Cab, smoldering over a core of plush black fruit that hides within. It's a pleasantly textured wine with soft, fine-grained tannins, but overwhelmed by smoke and a stalky, green finish."
Lanciola 2009 Le Masse di Greve Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Lanciola,Red,Le Masse di Greve Riserva,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$35,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"This wine opens with slightly rustic, leafy aromas that blow off in the glass to reveal mature black fruit and spice. The soft palate offers up ripe black cherry, blackberry and cinnamon. It's round and ready so enjoy soon."
Amity 1999 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Amity,Red,Estate,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$30,90,Paul Gregutt,"This is the last of Amity's '99s to be released; no '99 reserve was made because the juice went into three single-vineyard releases. With the extra time the wine has smoothed out a bit, but it is still tight and reticent upon first being opened. Good structure, some spicy highlights, and a concentrated, tarry finish."
Claudio Alario 2011  Barolo,Claudio Alario,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",,,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas that recall underbrush, oak, espresso, truffle and mocha unfold on this bracing red. The firm palate offers dried dark berry, sawdust, espresso, anise and ground pepper alongside assertive tannins."
Castello del Terriccio 2004 Tassinaia Red (Toscana),Castello del Terriccio,Red,Tassinaia,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$80,92,,"A blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this is a compelling and exciting expression of territory. The Tassinaia hill produces a balanced wine with black fruit and some herbal notes backed by spice, toast and a long satisfying finish."
Prinz Salm 2012 Scharlachberg Bingen Trocken GG Riesling (Rheinhessen),Prinz Salm,White,Scharlachberg Bingen Trocken GG,Riesling,"Rheinhessen, Germany",13.5%,$69,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Smoke tones blow off revealing layers of tropical fruit encased in wax and lanolin on this bold, nuanced wine. It's dry in style with a luscious, creamy texture cut with shards of acid and lime-zest astringency. Finishes long and lean."
Ruffino 1999 Aziano  (Chianti Classico),Ruffino,Red,Aziano,Sangiovese,"Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",13%,$15,84,,"The light cherry aromas and flavors with herb accents show a slight candied quality. Decent structure, but overall the wine is a bit narrow and closes with sharp, quite tart cherry fruit. It's youthful, for sure, and perhaps will even out with six to nine months in the bottle."
Volver 2005 Red (La Mancha),Volver,Red,,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","La Mancha, Central Spain, Spain",14.5%,$16,88,Michael Schachner,"Purple as they come, with extracted aromas of boysenberry, blackberry, maple and bacon. It's a wide, flush wine with bulk, 14.5% alcohol and savage flavors of blackberry and smoky BBQ. Definitely for fans of big, modern Spanish wines; Old World enthusiasts will probably call it “too modern” and overdone."
Feudi di San Gregorio 2005  Fiano di Avellino,Feudi di San Gregorio,White,,"Fiano, Italian White","Fiano di Avellino, Southern Italy, Italy",13%,$18,88,,"Peach, cantaloupe, pear and a touch of citric zest characterize this expertly made white wine from southern Italy. Beyond the fruit aromas, you'll also pick up notes of white flower and mineral-flint that add dimension and complexity. Drink it well-chilled with seafood or white meat."
Trapiche 2011 Terroir Series Orellana Single Vineyard Malbec (La Consulta),Trapiche,Red,Terroir Series Orellana Single Vineyard,Malbec,"La Consulta, Mendoza Province, Argentina",15%,$50,92,Michael Schachner,"Smoky blackberry aromas hint at raw charcoal and hickory. A deep, lush mouthfeel is mildly tannic, while toasty flavors of chocolate, herbs and menthol brush shoulders with blackberry and spice. This is big, deep, fruity and oaky on the finish. More time will only help it out; drink from 2016–2023."
Bodegas Bilbainas 2010 Viña Pomal Gran Reserva  (Rioja),Bodegas Bilbainas,Red,Viña Pomal Gran Reserva,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$50,93,Michael Schachner,"Balsamic berry aromas are heady and include tones of tobacco, cigar box and maple. This gran reserva from a fabulous vintage is solid and chewy, with ripe tannins that are firm but not too harsh. Baked berry flavors are augmented by chocolate and spice notes. It's dense and chewy on the finish, with just enough acidity to ensure balance and longevity. Drink through 2035."
Yalumba 2012 The Octavius Old Vine Shiraz (Barossa),Yalumba,Red,The Octavius Old Vine,,"Barossa, South Australia, Australia",14.1%,$120,93,Joe Czerwinski,"Named for the special format of small oak barrel it's aged in, this has soaked up the oak impressively. Hints of vanilla and graham crackers accent mixed berry fruit, while the finish is long and mouthwatering. There's ample concentration, yet the wine never seems heavy. Drinkable now, but why rush things? Drink 2020–2030."
Latah Creek 2005 Cabernet-Syrah (Washington),Latah Creek,Red,,,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$20,87,Paul Gregutt,"This 50/50 blend brings a bowl full of sweet cherry fruit to the nose; it's hard to resist after the first sniff. There's plenty of glycerin and a lushness to the mouthfeel, and the fruit flavors pile on sweet streaks of cherry, plum and raisin. Much of the pleasure is right up front, and the wine turns a bit stiff and stemmy as it heads down the back stretch."
Barnadown Run 1999 Heathcote Cabernet Sauvignon (Victoria),Barnadown Run,Red,Heathcote,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Victoria, Victoria, Australia",12.5%,$28,87,Joe Czerwinski,"Graves-like aromas of earth and tobacco laced with cassis are an instant hit; even the palate is Bordeaux-like, featuring a lean, chalky mouthfeel and drying tannins that demand cellaring. Age it one or two years and drink it over the next 3–5."
Anselmo Vineyards 2007 St. Pé de Bigorre Blanc White (California),Anselmo Vineyards,White,St. Pé de Bigorre Blanc,White Blend,"California, California Other, California, US",14.3%,$16,82,,"This blend of Gewürztraminer and Sauvignon Blanc is sweet and sour, like sugary cough lozenges, with pineapple and other citrus flavors."
Dutton Estate 2004 Jewell Block Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Dutton Estate,Red,Jewell Block Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$52,88,,"You'd never expect such nice flavor from such a lightly colored wine. Nonetheless, this single-vineyard Pinot is fresh and dry in rosehip tea, strawberry and cinnamon spice, with a bracing coat of toasty oak. It's not a blockbuster, but defines elegance."
Felsner 2004 Gedersdorfer Vordernberg Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),Felsner,White,Gedersdorfer Vordernberg,Grüner Veltliner,"Kremstal, Austria",13%,$19,86,Joe Czerwinski,"Smells and tastes like a combination of sun-warmed stones and white peaches. It's round and ripe, showing just a touch of alcoholic warmth on the finish. Imported by Grape Expectations (CA)."
Kilikanoon 2009 Green's Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley),Kilikanoon,Red,Green's Vineyard,,"Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$70,92,Joe Czerwinski,"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020."
SignoSeis 2014 The Angel Oak Reserva Malbec (Uco Valley),SignoSeis,Red,The Angel Oak Reserva,Malbec,"Uco Valley, Mendoza Province, Argentina",,$37,92,Michael Schachner,"Intensity and purity of fruit are virtues on an otherwise smoky nose with full ripeness. This wine is strong on the palate, with enlivening acidity. Peppery, chocolaty berry and cassis flavors finish dark, toasty and spicy, with some heat. Drink this bold Malbec through 2026."
Gemma 2013  Barolo,Gemma,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$35,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Red berry, underbrush, baking spice and leather aromas lead the nose. This is pretty straightforward by Barolo standards, offering morello cherry and light cinnamon flavors framed in firm tannins. Drink 2019–2025."
Marrenon 2014 Capella Syrah-Grenache (Ventoux),Marrenon,Red,Capella,"Syrah-Grenache, Rhône-style Red Blend","Ventoux, Rhône Valley, France",14%,$16,89,Joe Czerwinski,"This dark-hued blend of Syrah and Grenache shows ample length and suppleness to go along with aromas of fresh herbs, black cherries, espresso and black olives. It'd be a fine casual pairing for burgers or pizza."
Payana 2015 Malbec (Mendoza),Payana,Red,,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$12,87,Michael Schachner,"Earthy, gritty berry aromas announce a jammy palate with modest acidic bounce. Following the nose, this Malbec tastes earthy, jammy and a touch herbal. A lively finish with solid fruit flavors and juicy acidity provides for a nice close."
Martin Woods 2018 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Martin Woods,White,,Chardonnay,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.3%,$32,92,Paul Gregutt,"This lively wine has an electricity about it, with lip-smackingly delicious and crisp green apples. It's blended from McMinnville and Van Duzer Corridor grapes, with highlights of fresh green herbs and a finishing lick of buttery caramel."
Wine by Joe 2015 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),Wine by Joe,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$14,87,Paul Gregutt,"Almost indistinguishable from an all-stainless Chardonnay, this nonetheless offers fine value and clean crisp flavors. The basics of simple white wine are here—green apple and tart lemon, served up fresh and immediately drinkable."
Domaine Clavel 2018 Clair de Lune Saint Gervais White (Côtes du Rhône Villages),Domaine Clavel,White,Clair de Lune Saint Gervais,Rhône-style White Blend,"Côtes du Rhône Villages, Rhône Valley, France",13.5%,,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"In this wine hints of anise and marshmallow lend a sweet, spicy tone to zesty pear and quince aromas. A juicy, full-bodied white, it boasts concentrated yellow-apple flavor and fresh grapefruit acidity, with a lingering apple finish. Enjoy this easy-drinking but elegant wine now through 2023."
Sandro de Bruno 2007 Colli Scaligeri  (Soave),Sandro de Bruno,White,Colli Scaligeri,"Garganega, Italian White","Soave, Veneto, Italy",13%,$19,85,,"This is a very interesting and ultimately very likeable Soave with ripe aromas of banana, pineapple and loads of almond marzipan. The wine is light and short on the palate but those aromatic aftertastes stay etched in your memory."
Januik 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Januik,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.4%,VivinoWine.com,89,Paul Gregutt,"At first this wine seems quite astringent, closed and tight. It shows dark streaks of cassis and dried leaf, and it only reluctantly opens up to expand the black fruit flavor with a wash of Bourbon barrel."
Château Broustet 2011  Barsac,Château Broustet,Dessert,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Barsac, Bordeaux, France",14%,,90,Roger Voss,"Touches of toast from the wood aging give a spicy character. The toast brings out acidity at this stage rather than sweetness, with lemon and lime flavors dominant over the honey and botrytis in the background. Drink from 2018."
Cooperativa Agricola de Santo Isidro de Pegoes 2012 Adega de Pegões Aragonez (Península de Setúbal),Cooperativa Agricola de Santo Isidro de Pegoes,Red,Adega de Pegões,"Aragonez, Tempranillo","Península de Setúbal, Portugal",14.5%,,88,Roger Voss,"Aragonez, or Tempranillo, is grown more widely in Alentejo than in Setúbal where this wine comes from. The move gives the wine a softer character, with fresh blackberry acidity and a smooth, ripe fruitiness. It has some gentle tannins to balance the fruit. Drink now."
Wellington 2003 100 Year Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),Wellington,Red,100 Year Old Vines,Zinfandel,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$30,89,,"Fully dry, at the cost of 15.8% alcohol, this enormous Zin wears its size well. There's a Port-like, raisiny note, but it's more of a subtle seasoning than a takeover, and the wine is balanced in its own distinctively Zinny way."
Bodewell 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Bodewell,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13%,$15,89,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas bring appealing notes of fig, herb and whole lemon. Sleek, tart, citrus and tropical fruit flavors follow. It's tasty."
Amity 2007 Dry Gewürztraminer (Willamette Valley),Amity,White,Dry,Gewürztraminer,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$20,92,Paul Gregutt,"Exceptionally concentrated, unctuous and oily, this reveals the floral/spicy character of the grape in all its glory. It's a complex wine that just keeps on going, with jasmine, lemon polish, citrus and more fleshing out the flavors. The moderate alcohol and dry style keep it perfect for a range of foods, especially smoked salmon or spicy Thai."
Roar 2019 Soberanes Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),Roar,White,Soberanes Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.6%,$50,94,Matt Kettmann,"Very clean and suave aromas of chalk, lemon balm, lychee and a hint of salted nuts show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is a showcase of restrained opulence, offering peach and apricot flavors that are encapsulated in a chalky texture, all blasted by focused, driven notes of citrus zest."
Bruno Paillard 2004 Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),Bruno Paillard,Sparkling,Blanc de Blancs Brut,Chardonnay,"Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$90,95,Roger Voss,"This mature wine shows its toasty side. A mineral texture is now integrated with the almond, yeast and bread flavors to give a wine that's crisp while no longer bringing out its fruit. This wine is elegant with poise and great style. Drink now."
Rockpile Winery 2018 Rockpile Ridge Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),Rockpile Winery,Red,Rockpile Ridge Vineyard,Zinfandel,"Rockpile, Sonoma, California, US",14.57%,$49,93,Virginie Boone,"This estate wine is among the last picked by the producer due to the high-elevation vineyard. It tastes of blackberry, cherry, nutmeg and cola, with underlying notes of dried herb and crushed rock. The texture is velvety, with a lasting chewiness."
Tenuta di Fessina 2018 Erse Rosato (Etna),Tenuta di Fessina,Rose,Erse,"Rosato, Rosé","Etna, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13%,$25,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Rose petal, raspberry and Mediterranean brush aromas mingle together in the glass. On the tangy palate, brisk acidity accompanies pomegranate, strawberry and a note of botanical herbs."
Dillon 2011 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Yountville),Dillon,White,Barrel Fermented,Chardonnay,"Yountville, Napa, California, US",13.5%,$20,82,,"Simple and watery, it has oaky flavors of citrus fruits and peaches. There's not much going on, but it is dry and crisp in acidity."
Château le Thil 2018 Comte Clary  (Pessac-Léognan),Château le Thil,Red,Comte Clary,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",14.5%,$45,91,Roger Voss,"Obvious wood aging gives this wine a smoky character. At the same time, black-currant fruits are developing and promising a richly textured wine in the future. The wine, under the same winemaking team as Château Smith Haut Lafitte, is likely to be ready from 2024."
Peter Nicolay 2009 Bernkasteler Badstube Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),Peter Nicolay,White,Bernkasteler Badstube Kabinett,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",8.5%,$20,90,Joe Czerwinski,"Nicely balanced and nicely priced, this is a medium-bodied kabinett that would make delicious summertime drinking. It shows hints of wet stone, but also layers of sweet apple, pear and lemon fruit, which ease into a long, harmoniously crisp and clean finish."
Damian Rae 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Damian Rae,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.7%,$59,87,,"Very forward in jammy fruit, with waves of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, red currants, mocha and caramelized new oak. Feels too soft and melted to do much in the cellar, so drink up."
Cecchi 2015 La Mora  (Morellino di Scansano),Cecchi,Red,La Mora,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Morellino di Scansano, Tuscany, Italy",13%,$18,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Mature dark-skinned berry, sunbaked earth and pressed blue flower aromas come together on this charming red. The easy-drinking palate doles out ripe black cherry, raspberry and clove while supple tannins provide the relaxed framework."
Vaza 2013  Rioja,Vaza,Red,,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.6%,$12,86,Michael Schachner,"Despite some grit and tar on the nose, this Rioja opens well with spicy cherry and plum aromas. A standard, mild palate is satisfactory, while lightly roasted slightly briny plum and berry flavors end with a hint of saltiness."
Mazzei 2011 Codice V Vermentino (Toscana),Mazzei,White,Codice V,"Vermentino, Italian White","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13%,,87,,"This coastal Tuscan Vermentino delivers aromas of citrus, peach and white flower that give the wine a bright and beautiful bouquet. Touches of sweet honey and almond appear on the close."
Domaine Poulleau Père et Fils 2012 Les Mondes Rondes  (Côte de Beaune),Domaine Poulleau Père et Fils,Red,Les Mondes Rondes,Pinot Noir,"Côte de Beaune, Burgundy, France",12.5%,,87,Roger Voss,"Côte de Beaune is a small strip of land at the south end of the Beaune vineyards, not often seen as a stand-alone appellation. This gently structured wine is full of fresh fruits and attractive acidity. With its dry core, it could develop but is drinkable now."
Dr. Loosen 2003 Ürziger Würzgarten Spätlese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),Dr. Loosen,White,Ürziger Würzgarten Spätlese,Riesling,"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, Germany",8.5%,$28,85,Joe Czerwinski,"Starts with some lime and grapefruity notes, but seems to get softer as it moves toward the finish, ending with ripe flavors of apples, pears and even some stone fruit. Light in body, a tough trick in this sunbaked vintage. Imported by Loosen Bros. USA."
Paradise Ridge 2003 Hoenselaars Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Paradise Ridge,Red,Hoenselaars Vineyard,Zinfandel,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$30,82,,"Too soft and syrupy for my tastes, with a viscous texture framing blackberry and coffee flavors. Just lacks life and zest."
Langtry 2006 Lillie Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),Langtry,White,Lillie,Sauvignon Blanc,"Lake County, Lake County, California, US",13.5%,$25,86,,"This is a vineyard selection from the winery's estate, and it's a nicely drinkable Sauvignon Blanc, showing how well the variety does in Lake County. Fresh and juicy, the pineapple and fig flavors finish with a honeyed richness."
Château Crabitey 2017 Barrel Sample  (Graves),Château Crabitey,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Graves, Bordeaux, France",,,88,Roger Voss,"87–89. Barrel Sample. Tight and tannic, this is a weighty and concentrated wine. Its rich berry fruits are integrated with the structure already, supplying fine fruitiness and crisp acidity."
Cristom 2018 Marjorie vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),Cristom,Red,Marjorie vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14%,$75,93,Paul Gregutt,"Sourced from the estate's oldest vines, this lovely wine is a complex mix of red and blue berries, with pretty highlights of chocolate and mocha from aging 17 months in two-thirds new French oak. Though not labeled as a reserve, it brings an extra dollop of detail and depth."
Achaia Clauss NV Demestica White White (Greece),Achaia Clauss,White,Demestica White,White Blend,"Greece, Greece",11%,$10,82,Susan Kostrzewa,"This blend of Savatiano and Roditis is very popular in Greece and perhaps a bit too exotic for mainstream palates, but it's easy drinking and priced well. Aromas of citrus and melon are followed by peach and honeydew melon flavors. Simple but friendly."
Schloss Vollrads 2016 Auslese Riesling (Rheingau),Schloss Vollrads,White,Auslese,Riesling,"Rheingau, Germany",7.5%,$45,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Ethereally light in texture, this intriguing Auslese calibrates pristine tangerine and peach flavors against savory notes of pollen and earth. It's spry and spine-tingling, with a long, floral finish. It drinks well now, but should meld and improve from 2021–2030."
Indian Springs 1997 Viognier (Nevada County),Indian Springs,White,,Viognier,"Nevada County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",,$14,83,,"From the Sierra Foothills, it shows pretty citrus and tropical fruit aromas. Very fruity, with a strong chocolate note, which California Viognier often has."
Januik 2012 Champoux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),Januik,Red,Champoux Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.4%,$55,93,Sean P. Sullivan,"Almost all varietal (with 2% Malbec) from one of the state's premier sites, this wine draws you into the glass with aromas of coffee, scorched earth, herb, spice and dark fruit. The palate shows a beguiling sense of restraint and detail, with the tannins combed to a fine sheen, perfectly framed acidity and a lengthy finish. It's an exquisite example of the variety that should have a long life ahead of it. It will be best after 2020."
Delamotte NV Brut  (Champagne),Delamotte,Sparkling,Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$33,87,Michael Schachner,"A bouquet of baked apples, pear and burnt brown sugar kicks it off. Next comes a soft palate of pineapple, papaya and lemon, and then a finish of apples and white pepper. Lovely flavors and plenty of depth push it forward. However, the bead is so light that the wine goes flat in the glass."
Anko 2012 Torrontés (Salta),Anko,White,,Torrontés,"Salta, Other, Argentina",13%,$14,85,Michael Schachner,"The bouquet is a bit oily and heavy as it dishes primary orange aromas and also cured ham notes. The palate is bulky and a touch oily in feel, with flat-edged papaya and melon flavors that dry out on a chunky finish."
Curtis 2011 Roussanne (Santa Barbara County),Curtis,White,,Roussanne,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$25,90,,"One of the better Roussannes out there, this is dry with balanced acidity, showing a creamy mouthfeel, plus complex citrus, butterscotch, mineral and spice flavors. It has many food-pairing possibilities."
Casa da Passarella 2012 O Oenólgo Encruzado (Dão),Casa da Passarella,White,O Oenólgo,"Encruzado, Portuguese White","Dão, Portugal",13%,$32,91,Roger Voss,"A ripe and fruity wine that boasts yellow fruits and fresh citrus characteristics. It's lush and ripe, with just a touch of minerality to give the wine structure. There's a delicious tangy aftertaste to this full, impressive wine."
St. Francis 2010 Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),St. Francis,Red,,Petite Sirah,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.7%,$45,92,,"This is great Petite Sirah, and classically Dry Creek Valley in style. It has the weight and texture of a fine Cabernet, with gorgeously smooth tannins, but it's the flavors that really make you reach for another glass. Offers blackberries, black currants, bacon, charred meat bone, pepper and anise flavors that go on and on into a long finish. Will age for a long time, but you can drink it at any point in its journey."
Müller-Catoir 2007 Mandelring Auslese Scheurebe (Pfalz),Müller-Catoir,White,Mandelring Auslese,"Scheurebe, Other White","Pfalz, Germany",,$66,92,Joe Czerwinski,"Shows off some of Scheurebe's exotic personality, delivering banana notes alongside pink grapefruit and dried apricot aromas and flavors. It's oily in texture and very sweet, but balanced by those grapefruity acids. Drink young for the flamboyance of the grape variety."
Fulldraw 2018 Hard Point Grenache (Paso Robles),Fulldraw,Red,Hard Point,Grenache,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15.6%,$85,93,Matt Kettmann,"Fresh boysenberry aromas are cut by peppery spices, roasted coffee and lavender on the dynamic nose of this bottling. The palate begins softly with a wide array of floral flavors, from wisteria to elderflower, and then settles into fine-grained tannins toward the finish."
Browne Family Vineyards 2017 Skull &amp; Chain Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),Browne Family Vineyards,Red,Skull & Chain,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.2%,$20,87,Sean P. Sullivan,Fresh green herb aromas are out front along with satsuma notes. The flavors are light and direct. Decant for best effect.
B.R. Cohn 2011 Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),B.R. Cohn,White,Sangiacomo Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$35,90,Virginie Boone,"A barrel-fermented Chardonnay with creamy texture, this opens with bright, prominent Meyer lemon notes before delving into softer flavors of pear and vanilla on the midpalate. The acidity holds through to the finish, accented by a touch of honey."
Fenestra NV True Red Lot 26 Red (California),Fenestra,Red,True Red Lot 26,"Red Blends, Red Blends","California, California Other, California, US",13.8%,$12,87,Virginie Boone,"This is an easy-drinking blend of many red varieties from a Livermore-based producer who loves both Rhône and Portuguese reds. This is soft and lightly spiced, with cola and cherry notes on the finish. A very good wine for a barbecue or a tailgate."
Casa da Passarella 2013 Colheita Branco White (Dão),Casa da Passarella,White,Colheita Branco,Portuguese White,"Dão, Portugal",12.5%,$14,90,Roger Voss,"This intensely fruity wine is full of crisp acidity, lemon and lime flavors and a tangy, tight, steely texture. The wine is mineral and structured, while remaining fresh and attractively juicy. It's tempting to drink it now because of the freshness, but better wait until 2016."
Delta Vineyard 2005 Hatter's Hill Pinot Noir (Marlborough),Delta Vineyard,Red,Hatter's Hill,Pinot Noir,"Marlborough, New Zealand",14.5%,$29,90,Joe Czerwinski,"This is a full-bodied, supple rendition of Marlborough Pinot Noir, boasting smoky, slightly herbal-peppery scents and bold cherry and plum fruit. There's a suggestion of sassafras or cola as well, which gives this wine an almost Californian flavor. Long and velvety on the finish."
Clos La Chance 1997 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Clos La Chance,White,,Chardonnay,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$18,90,Joe Czerwinski,"Smoke and toast aromas are accented by butter and spicy vanilla notes. Full and round, it's a big yet graceful Chardonnay, reminiscent of the ballerina hippo in Disney's Fantasia."
Estampa 2005 Reserve Assemblage White (Central Valley),Estampa,White,Reserve Assemblage,White Blend,"Central Valley, Chile",13.5%,$12,88,Michael Schachner,"Predominantly Sauvignon Blanc, and you get those varietal grassy, citric aromas and flavors as the main package. Chardonnay and Viognier at 15% each add roundness and riper flavors, particularly peach and apple. And it's minimally oak-aged, which adds to the mouthfeel. An interesting Chilean blend."
Ashan 2018 Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Ashan,White,Conner Lee Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",15%,$40,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"Barrel fermented and aged in 100% new French oak, this Chardonnay offers aromas of toast, lees, apple and spice leading to sweet-seeming, center-focused, creamy flavors. The lees influence is primary at present. It runs hot on the finish."
Dubourdieu 2018 Liason  (Bordeaux Blanc),Dubourdieu,White,Liason,,"Bordeaux Blanc, Bordeaux, France",12.5%,$20,90,Roger Voss,"This is a typical blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, but one that has been produced by a family famed for its white wines. This is warm with yellow fruits as well as citrus, showing a rounded texture as well as herbal minerality. Drink this wine now."
Bel Arbor 2000 Merlot (Mendocino County),Bel Arbor,Red,,Merlot,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",13.5%,$6,83,,"Gets the job done with a burst of jammy Lifesaver aromas and flavors. Lightly structured. There are some less ripe, green, stalky flavors that lead to a tart finish in this dry wine."
Murphy-Goode 1997 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Murphy-Goode,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$30,91,Michael Schachner,"Light-to-medium-bodied, but hardly weak.  An elegant Pinot that amply reflects what people mean when they say “Russian River Pinot Noir.”  Cinnamon spice, brambly raspberry, and stylish sweet oak throughout.  An intriguing and impressive first-ever M-G Pinot from Olivet Lane and Home Vineyards."
Château Thieuley 2012  Bordeaux Blanc,Château Thieuley,White,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Bordeaux Blanc, Bordeaux, France",,$12,89,Roger Voss,"Soft and smooth, this is a wine that is still developing its full potential. The fruit is subdued but should burst into richness in the next six months with apricot and spice flavors that show strongly."
Bodega José Quattrocchi 2002 Nino Franco Torrontés (Mendoza),Bodega José Quattrocchi,White,Nino Franco,Torrontés,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13%,$13,80,Michael Schachner,"The dark hue and thick, sweet aromas announce that, just like the label says, this wine was oaked. What emerges from the glass is a cloying honey and orange-laden confection. It's pretty aggressive stuff with too many odd and out of place flavors, i.e. creamed corn. Acceptable, but just. –M.S."
Ego Bodegas 2017 Goru El Blanco White (Jumilla),Ego Bodegas,White,Goru El Blanco,White Blend,"Jumilla, Levante, Spain",13.5%,$15,87,Michael Schachner,"Floral aromas include whiffs of jasmine and peach blossom, scents you can attribute to the Moscatel in this blend that also includes Chardonnay. In the mouth, this is a touch oily in feel but also acidic. Flowery, tropical flavors of lychee and pineapple finish full and healthy."
Antonopoulos 2003 Collection White Dry Table Wine White (Greece),Antonopoulos,White,Collection White Dry Table Wine,White Blend,"Greece, Greece",13%,$15,86,Joe Czerwinski,"Shows some toasty, caramel-popcorm scents, but also pleasant enough peach, pineapple and lemon flavors.

Iijima,"A bit firmer and more powerful than the producer's regular bottling, the Vintner's Select boasts a core of black cherry and cassis accented by shades of bramble and forest floor.

Casa Castillo 2012 Las Gravas Red (Jumilla),Casa Castillo,Red,Las Gravas,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Jumilla, Levante, Spain",15%,$32,88,Michael Schachner,"Ripe and soft on the nose, this blend of Monastrell, Garnacha and Syrah is so easygoing that it lacks pop up front. Plump and fruity on the palate, this is low on structure and acidity. Jammy raspberry and strawberry flavors end in friendly fashion, but with low definition. Drink now."
Domaine des Tilleuls 2011 Haute Sélection Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),Domaine des Tilleuls,White,Haute Sélection Sur Lie,"Melon, Other White","Muscadet Sèvre et Maine, Loire Valley, France",12%,,86,Roger Voss,"Taut, light and crisp, this Muscadet boasts fresh citrus flavor and apple-skin structure.

King Estate 2011 Signature Pinot Gris (Oregon),King Estate,White,Signature,,"Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",13%,$17,88,Paul Gregutt,"This is a benchmark rendition of Pinot Gris.

Beringer 2003 Alluvium Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Knights Valley),Beringer,White,Alluvium Blanc,"Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon, White Blend","Knights Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$16,85,,"Seems a bit overwrought, with too much oak framing too little fruit. But it's a pleasant, dry wine, with citrus and buttercream flavors and enough acidity for balance."
Bruno Giacosa 2011 Falletto  (Barolo),Bruno Giacosa,Red,Falletto,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",15%,$250,95,Kerin O’Keefe,"One of the most balanced and impressive Barolos from the hot 2011 vintage, this opens with alluring aromas of mature black cherry, tobacco and spice.

It hits the palate with undeniable sweetness, but then come strong sandalwood and cedar flavors and a rush of vanilla and clove. It is soft while penetrating, like a dagger under silk lace."

The juicy, savory palate offers red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and a hint of grilled porcini framed in taut, polished tannins. Tangy acidity keeps it bright.

Melrose 2006 Viognier (Umpqua Valley),Melrose,White,,Viognier,"Umpqua Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",,$18,82,Paul Gregutt,"This is a light, spritzy wine; it could almost qualify as frizzante. The light citrus flavors start out fine, then become rough and vegetal."

Ponzi 2008 Riesling (Willamette Valley),Ponzi,White,,Riesling,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$17,88,Paul Gregutt,"Ponzi makes very little Riesling, which is a shame, because this is a big, full-bodied, leesy, mineral-soaked mouthful of fresh, zesty flavor. Whole cluster pressed, stainless steel fermentation, and 13% alcohol, it's a wine to gulp down by the glass. Pure pleasure."

Cellar the wine 10 years or more to achieve balance between its firm tannins and bright acidity. The wine already shows incredibly complex aromas of wild berry fruit, truffle and cola and those tones will surely become more elegant with time."

Château de Maligny 2010  Chablis,Château de Maligny,White,,Chardonnay,"Chablis, Burgundy, France",12.5%,$24,86,Roger Voss,"Soft and rounded, this is touched by a note of vanilla that adds extra openness. With its apple and pear flavors, this is an attractive, fruity wine; it's very forward, but it shows a note of Chablis steel in the background."

The '05 is semisweet and simple, with candied cherry-blackberry flavors that finish more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine."

It's radiant burnt orange in hue, with an equally sunny disposition. High-toned aromas of candied citrus, flan, roasted nuts and a damp woodsy underbelly lead to a mouthfeel that's rich but not unctuous, sweet but not cloying.

Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14%,$40,93,Matt Kettmann,"Cola, blueberry and red fruits meet with sweet tobacco and peppercorn-crusted beef on the nose of this foot-stomped bottling.

Quinta de Pancas 1996 Cabernet Sauvignon (Estremadura),Quinta de Pancas,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Estremadura, Portugal",,$13,83,Jesica Vargas,"Green peppers and a stemmy quality mar the nose, which is otherwise closed.

The grape sources—Champoux, Klipsun and Bacchus vineyards— are impeccable. Tannins are stiff enough to put a stop to the finish, and to suggest that some further bottle age is called for."
Leonetti Cellar 2011 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Leonetti Cellar,Red,,Sangiovese,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.1%,$65,92,Paul Gregutt,"This Sangiovese was as usual co-fermented with Syrah (13%), and sourced from a mix of estate vineyards. Smooth and supple, it's a sweetly appealing wine, loaded with strawberry preserves, but also detailed with impressive notes of Italian herbs and a whiff of tomato paste. As befits the variety, the underpinning of natural acidity lifts the finish beautifully, and suggests aging it through 2020."

This is a wine that rolls sumptuously around the mouth, the tannins certainly dense but full of the same sweetness as the fruit. The final flavor is perfumed and fresh.

The palate is plump and loaded with strawberry and vanilla flavors, then chocolate shows up on the finish. The blend is 41% Garnacha, 41% Syrah and 18% Cab Sauvignon."

Caves Velhas 2013 D. Fuas Reserva Red (Terras do Dão),Caves Velhas,Red,D. Fuas Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Terras do Dão, Portugal",13%,$7,89,Roger Voss,"This is a herbal, earthy wine with as many tannins as fruit at this stage. That gives it a dense, dusty texture that seeps into the ripe, sweet plum flavors. With the wood giving an extra push of richness as well as spice, it needs to age. Drink from 2017."
Loma Larga 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),Loma Larga,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Casablanca Valley, Chile",13%,$20,88,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of radiator dust, melon, apple cider and minerals are intriguing and suggest good quality.

Molino 2011 Teorema  (Barbaresco),Molino,Red,Teorema,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$35,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"This isn't overly expressive but reveals nuances of blue flower, black cherry and chocolate that carry over to the palate along with prune and roasted coffee bean. Drying wood tannins give it a mouthpuckering close."
Lion Ranch 2018 Marsanne (Santa Clara Valley),Lion Ranch,White,,Marsanne,"Santa Clara Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.7%,$28,88,Matt Kettmann,"Tightly woven aromas of citrus peel, green plums and struck flint show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is also brisk and somewhat austere, with slightly sour fruit flavors."
Quinta do Vallado 2016 Vallado Touriga Nacional Rosé (Douro),Quinta do Vallado,Rose,Vallado Touriga Nacional,Rosé,"Douro, Portugal",12%,$23,87,Roger Voss,"This crisp wine is as light as a feather—fruity and perfumed. The fruit came from the highest altitude of the quinta, resulting in the wine's cool character and considerable acidity. Drink now."
Henry Fessy 2014  Beaujolais-Villages,Henry Fessy,Red,,Gamay,"Beaujolais-Villages, Beaujolais, France",12.5%,$12,86,Roger Voss,"This broad, ripe wine has plenty of ripe red fruits but the minimum of structure. It is soft, generous and ready to drink. Much of the hand-picked production is from old vines on a 45-degree slope."
King Estate 2014 Croft Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),King Estate,Red,Croft,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14%,$60,91,Paul Gregutt,"Tart cranberry and pomegranate fruit is front and center in this wine, streaked with an herbed butter accent. Barrel aged for a year in 30% new French oak, it's smooth and silky in feel. The tannins are somewhat astringent but should soften in time."
Seifried 2003 Sauvignon Blanc (Nelson),Seifried,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Nelson, New Zealand",12.5%,$18,88,Joe Czerwinski,"This zippy, fresh Savvy wakes up the palate like a citrus sorbet after a big meal. It's refreshing with bright acidity and flavors of limes, smoke and just the barest hint of green pepper."
Criss Cross 2014 Petite Sirah (Clarksburg),Criss Cross,Red,,Petite Sirah,"Clarksburg, Central Valley, California, US",13.8%,$16,89,Jim Gordon,"This affordable wine is smooth and deeply fruity, rather full bodied, and quite enjoyable for the ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors. Not as tannic as some, it still has a moderately gripping texture that will be perfect with grilled meat."
Villa Andriana 2013 Muscat Canelli (Knights Valley),Villa Andriana,Dessert,,"Muscat Canelli, Muscat","Knights Valley, Sonoma, California, US",11.3%,$20,84,,"The orange, lemon, honey and vanilla flavors are a little thin, but crisp acidity and a sweet finish make the wine likeable, perhaps nice on a summer night."
Frog's Leap 1999 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Frog's Leap,Red,,Zinfandel,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14%,$22,85,,"A soft, floral-talc note coats earth and juicy red fruit on the comforting, almost sexy, nose. On the palate, flat blackberry and strawberry notes take on a bit of tanginess, thanks to the oak. It's medium to light in weight—this is no heavy-hitter—and finishes a little thin, the floral-talc note returning. The nose is the best part; the wine lightens up considerably after that. —D.M."
Caliza 2013 Syrah (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),Caliza,Red,,,"Paso Robles Willow Creek District, Central Coast, California, US",15.7%,$62,93,Matt Kettmann,"Dark in the glass, this wine by Carl Bowker offers fragrant vanilla, baked blueberry, a touch of pepper and coffee-cocoa foam on the rich and inviting nose. Hearty blueberry and blackberry fruit flavors are lifted by baking spice, bound to a tart, tannic, black-plum-skin-like structure."
Château Branaire-Ducru 2013 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Julien),Château Branaire-Ducru,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Julien, Bordeaux, France",,,92,Roger Voss,"91–93. Barrel Sample. Full of ripe fruit, this is a fine and rich wine. It has a good balance between fresh acidity and sweet berry fruit. With its bold structure, this is a wine for aging."
1+1=3 NV Mètode Tradicional Brut Sparkling (Cava),1+1=3,Sparkling,Mètode Tradicional Brut,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Cava, Catalonia, Spain",11.5%,DrizlyVivino,88,Michael Schachner,"Confident saline and citrus aromas are a good entry to this clean, fairly lean brut. Lime and tangerine flavors are racy and not too sweet, while this is fresh and well made on the finish."
Patient Cottat 2019 Le Grand Caillou Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Patient Cottat,Red,Le Grand Caillou,Pinot Noir,"Vin de France, France Other, France",12.5%,$16,86,Roger Voss,"Ripe, spicy and warm, this wine has a light structure that supports the blackberry fruits. A crisp edge contrasts with the full, fruity aftertaste."
Domaine de Leyre-Loup 2015  Fleurie,Domaine de Leyre-Loup,Red,,Gamay,"Fleurie, Beaujolais, France",13%,$20,89,Roger Voss,"While this wine is initially juicy, its structure shows later, coming from behind to give tannins and weight to the black-fruit flavors. It is now fully balanced, rich and fruity."
Barão de Vilar 2011 Palmer  (Port),Barão de Vilar,Port/Sherry,Palmer,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,,91,Roger Voss,"Fine tannins and attractive acidity set the scene for a wine that is structured and rich in perfumed berry fruits, with a dry, dark core. It is an impressive, ripe wine, still developing and filling out. Drink from 2018."
Acorn 2003 Alegria Vineyards Sangiovese (Russian River Valley),Acorn,Red,Alegria Vineyards,Sangiovese,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$22,87,,"This is a pretty good Sangiovese and Acorn has worked hard on the variety for years. It's dry and elegant, with silky, Pinot-like tannins and crisp acids. It's also very ripe in cherry and cocoa flavors."
DFJ Vinhos 2009 Point West Touriga Nacional (Lisboa),DFJ Vinhos,Red,Point West,"Touriga Nacional, Portuguese Red","Lisboa, Portugal",13%,$9,87,Roger Voss,"This wine emphasizes the fruit of Touriga Nacional rather than its structure. Ripe red-plum fruits dominate, cushioning acidity and tannins with fruity richness. It's for drinking now or aging until 2015."
Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos 2009 Dona Maria Amantis Reserva Red (Alentejano),Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos,Red,Dona Maria Amantis Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Alentejano, Portugal",14.5%,,86,Roger Voss,"The wine tastes old before its years. It has a leathery character and prominent acidity rather than fruit. It has interest, with its dried fruits and tannins that are just on the point of drying out. Drink now."
Canoe Ridge 2002 Oak Ridge Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Washington),Canoe Ridge,White,Oak Ridge Vineyard,Gewürztraminer,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$13,90,Paul Gregutt,"The winery always does well with this tricky grape, somehow walking the line between floral and oily, sweet and dry, and coming up with intensity that doesn't tire out the palate. Complex and lingering, it's perfect for southeast Asian cuisine."
Havens 2000 Hudson Vineyard Syrah (Carneros),Havens,Red,Hudson Vineyard,,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",,$45,86,,"This is a good wine from a less-than-successful vintage. The blackberry flavors have a raw, unfinished edge that liberal oak cannot sweeten. There's also a streak of tart acidity that leads to a dry, puckery finish."
Hampton Water 2020 Rosé (Languedoc),Hampton Water,Rose,,Rosé,"Languedoc, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",14.2%,$23,91,Lauren Buzzeo,"Lovely top notes of peony and baby's breath grace the bouquet of this rosé, with supporting notes of ripe melon, white cherry and strawberry at the core. The palate is medium in weight but well balanced, with a sweet orange flavor and bright acidic thread that keeps the momentum moving from the fruit-fueled palate to the vibrant, refreshing finish."
Jean Laurent 2006 La Griffe de l'Ource Blanc de Blancs Brut  (Champagne),Jean Laurent,Sparkling,La Griffe de l'Ource Blanc de Blancs Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$107,93,Roger Voss,"One of a pair of 100% varietal wines produced from vines in Celles-sur-Ource, this Chardonnay is taut and structured while having the extra richness of the Aube. Acidity and crisp texture give this ripe wine a good balance. Drink now."
Masi 2006 Serego Alighieri Possessioni White (Veneto),Masi,White,Serego Alighieri Possessioni,White Blend,"Veneto, Veneto, Italy",13.2%,$15,87,,"Native Italian grape Garganega and Sauvignon Blanc are blended to produce a layered white wine with fresh tones of stone fruit, kiwi, melon and lemon zest. This interesting combination offers good, fresh acidity and vibrant fruit flavors."
Multi 2015 Best Vintage Red (Central Valley),Multi,Red,Best Vintage,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Central Valley, Chile",14%,$50,93,Michael Schachner,"A weighty yet balanced nose offers bold berry aromas matched by oaky notes of mocha, vanilla and marshmallow. Racy acidity and firm tannins lend brightness and grit to the palate, while this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend tastes of blackberry, cassis and supporting spice notes. A smooth and mellow finish is a fine conclusion to this fruit-forward blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Carmenère and Syrah. Drink through 2024."
Benanti 2019 Rosato (Etna),Benanti,Rose,,"Rosato, Rosé","Etna, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13%,$20,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"Informal and refreshing, this light-bodied rosé has flavors suggesting tart sour cherry, unripe strawberry and a hint of saline. It's simple but well-made, with a crisp finish."
Nitída 2003 Sémillon (Durbanville),Nitída,White,,Sémillon,"Durbanville, South Africa",13.8%,$13,82,,"A dry white with a smooth mouthfeel and some typical Sémillon waxiness to boot. Still, a strong, unyielding bell pepper quality detracts throughout. Closes clean with a slight grainy feel, but it's just too green and lean."
Château du Petit Lac 2015 Red (Bergerac),Château du Petit Lac,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bergerac, Southwest France, France",13.5%,$15,87,Roger Voss,"A classic Bordeaux-style blend with Merlot dominant, this wine has an attractively luscious texture full of rich berry flavors. The tannins are there, but they are light, emphasizing the wine's fruitiness. It is developing quickly and will be ready to drink from 2019"
Barton & Guestier 2002 Chardonnay (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Barton & Guestier,White,,Chardonnay,"Vin de Pays d'Oc, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",,$6,82,Roger Voss,"There are sweet vanilla aromas, along with aromas of green plums. This is a soft, creamy wine, with just a touch of greeness, and a full, creamy texture."
Carpe Diem 2005 Firepeak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),Carpe Diem,Red,Firepeak Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$28,89,,"The '05, as befits the cool vintage, is very dry and crisply elegant, with crushed cherry, raspberry and root beer flavors boosted by a squirt of lime juice, enriched by sweet vanilla and oak. Best now–2008."
Gomba Boschetti 2014 Sernie  (Barolo),Gomba Boschetti,Red,Sernie,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$55,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"Subdued aromas of toasted oak, baking spice and graphite guide the nose. The dense palate delivers raw sour cherry, clove and vanilla while assertive tannins give it an astringent finish."
Brotte 2003 Domaine du Versant Doré  (Condrieu),Brotte,White,Domaine du Versant Doré,Viognier,"Condrieu, Rhône Valley, France",13.5%,$48,82,Joe Czerwinski,"Odd stuff, with vegetal notes appearing in place of the ripe floral aromas expected of Viognier. Corn, lime and green tomatoes all show up on the nose or in the mouth, along with a slightly oily mouthfeel."
Château de Saint-Cosme 2018  Condrieu,Château de Saint-Cosme,White,,Viognier,"Condrieu, Rhône Valley, France",14.5%,$85,95,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Hints of sweet spice and smoke seep into sunny apricot and honeysuckle in this lavishly rounded Viognier. It's a classically fleshy, weighty wine with a delightfully clingy finish, but cutting mineral tones and crisp tangerine acidity lend lift and vitality, too. Excellent in youth but concentrated enough to mature well through 2040."
Costers del Priorat 2003 Pissarres Red (Priorat),Costers del Priorat,Red,Pissarres,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Priorat, Catalonia, Spain",14%,$25,83,Michael Schachner,"Raw and rugged at first. The mouth offers a bit more, although even here the raspberry and plum flavors are spread thin. Has its merits but also some faults, primarily a finish that's not far enough removed from cough syrup."
Doffo 2015 Vintners Selection Zinfandel (Temecula Valley),Doffo,Red,Vintners Selection,Zinfandel,"Temecula Valley, South Coast, California, US",15.4%,$125,91,Matt Kettmann,"Rustic but pleasant aromas of blistered berries, plums, oak and licorice invite the nose into this bottling. Chalky tannins frame the sip, where roasted black fruit and an array of brown spices lead into a vanilla-kissed finish."
Laetitia 2006 Estate Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),Laetitia,Red,Estate,Pinot Noir,"Arroyo Grande Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$25,87,,"A lovely, crisp wine that shows many of the excellent characteristics of Laetitia's more expensive vineyard block bottlings, without the complexity. You'll find the same fine acidity, rich tannins and cherry and cola flavors, compromised only by some green mint dilution."
Ruggeri & C. NV Frizzante Gentile  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),Ruggeri & C.,Sparkling,Frizzante Gentile,"Prosecco, Sparkling","Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene, Veneto, Italy",,$16,84,,"This is a very sweet-smelling frizzante with intense aromas of peach, exotic fruit and kiwi. The mouthfeel is lean and somewhat watery but the wine cleans the palate thanks to its natural crispness."
Château Riotor 2009 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),Château Riotor,Rose,,Rosé,"Côtes de Provence, Provence, France",13.5%,$14,89,Roger Voss,"Under the same family ownership as Château Mont-Redon in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this is soft, ripe and rich. Hints of caramel, a light sprinkling of toast flavors and spice. Full-bodied wine that works best with food."
Domaine Ansen 2015 Struch Brut Nature Auxerrois (Crémant d'Alsace),Domaine Ansen,Sparkling,Struch Brut Nature,"Auxerrois, Other White","Crémant d'Alsace, Alsace, France",12%,$42,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Rounded, creamy notes of ripe and mellow apple stream from the glass. The palate is equally mellow and creamy, with an inherent bright freshness and a wonderfully creamy midpalate. Notions of freshly baked shortbread pastry join the apple notes and make for a very balanced, textured and rounded palate, vivid with apple freshness. This is lovely now, but sure to evolve in bottle. The finish is dry and creamy. Drink now through 2025."
Domaine Franck Besson 2018 Le Griottier  (Juliénas),Domaine Franck Besson,Red,Le Griottier,Gamay,"Juliénas, Beaujolais, France",13%,$25,89,Roger Voss,"From a vineyard that was once a cherry orchard, this wine is vibrant with red-berry flavors and juicy fruitiness. While it is lightly textured, it is really a wine to drink young, from late 2021."
Brick & Mortar 2018 Manchester Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (Mendocino Ridge),Brick & Mortar,White,Manchester Ridge Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Mendocino Ridge, Mendocino County, California, US",12.5%,$48,91,Jim Gordon,"Deep but lively fruit flavors energize this medium-bodied wine with tangy apples and vibrant lemons while light mineral tones add complexity. Grown at relatively high elevation, it is absolutely clean and fresh, showing little oak influence."
Quickfire 2007 Top Chef Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Quickfire,Red,Top Chef Selection,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$22,85,,"A full-bodied, spicy Cabernet, with lots of jammy blackberry and cherry fruit. Drink this robust young wine now."
Le Vigne di Eli 2013 Bianco  (Etna),Le Vigne di Eli,White,Bianco,"Carricante, Italian White","Etna, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",12.5%,$25,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Delicate aromas of lemon blossom, pear, Spanish broom and brimstone lead the nose on this vibrant white. The bright palate offers citrus, apple and mineral along with a touch of light oak that adds depth, while crisp acidity imparts energy."
La Jota Vineyard 2007 Cabernet Franc (Howell Mountain),La Jota Vineyard,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"Howell Mountain, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$75,90,,"A big, vital, dramatic wine, one of the finest Cab Francs of the vintage. Dazzles with blackberry, black cherry, mocha and spice flavors, wrapped into thick but finely ground tannins, and enriched with smoky oak. Beautiful now and for the next 4–5 years."
Tenute del Cerro 2009  Montefalco Sagrantino,Tenute del Cerro,Red,,"Sagrantino, Italian Red","Montefalco Sagrantino, Central Italy, Italy",14.5%,$28,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of leafy underbrush, roasted coffee bean and dried black cherry open this robust wine. The palate offers prune, fig, oak, blueberry extract, vanilla and espresso framed in firm tannins."
Keeler 2017 Terracotta Amphorae Riesling (Eola-Amity Hills),Keeler,White,Terracotta Amphorae,Riesling,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",11.6%,$32,93,Paul Gregutt,"Keeler is doing some interesting experimentation with fermentation methods, and here they deliver a stunning amphora-fermented, off-dry Riesling. The wine offers a fine mix of apricot, peach and nectarine tones that display a sweet and sour tension. It finishes with a lick of butterscotch."
Château Eugénie 2009 Cuvée Pierre le Grand  (Cahors),Château Eugénie,Red,Cuvée Pierre le Grand,"Malbec-Merlot, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Cahors, Southwest France, France",13.5%,$20,92,Roger Voss,"Perfumed aromas give this wine a smooth, polished feel. Hints of mint go with the well integrated tannins that firm up the sweet blackberry flavors. A great ripe swathe of fruit is laced with acidity on the finish."
Peachy Canyon 2001 Mr. Wilson's Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),Peachy Canyon,Red,Mr. Wilson's Vineyard,Zinfandel,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",,$26,88,,"A smooth-textured wine that sports a pretty core of cherry, plum, coffee and chocolate flavors. The tannins are firm and ripe and offer a good framework to support the flavors."
Seebrich 2006 Niersteiner Oelberg Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheinhessen),Seebrich,White,Niersteiner Oelberg Beerenauslese,Riesling,"Rheinhessen, Germany",7.5%,$48,93,Joe Czerwinski,"Sweet and slightly viscous in texture, this wine lacks some aromatic flourishes, sacrificing complexity for purity of its pineapple, apple and citrus flavors. Yet because of its balanced, crisp acidity, the wine still sings, finishing long and mouthwatering. Drink now–2030."
Batzella 2007 Mezzodì White (Bolgheri),Batzella,White,Mezzodì,White Blend,"Bolgheri, Tuscany, Italy",,$23,88,,"Viognier and Vermentino spend some time in both stainless steel and oak, which gives this blend fresh aromas and a creamy palate. Stone fruit, apricot, honey and white flower notes are accompanied by mildly spicy overtones."
Williams Selyem 2018 Vista Verde Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Benito County),Williams Selyem,Red,Vista Verde Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"San Benito County, Central Coast, California, US",13.3%,$65,94,Matt Kettmann,"This wine begins with zesty aromas of black raspberry, poached cherry and hibiscus accented by mace and clove. Flavors of roasted cranberry and black raspberry converge with star anise and black licorice on the delicious palate."
J. Scott Cellars 2015 Albariño (Oregon),J. Scott Cellars,White,,Albariño,"Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",13.1%,$18,90,Paul Gregutt,"Not such a rarity these days, Albariño is turning heads in California and Oregon. This tart, juicy, and deliciously fresh effort is loaded with tangy citrus and green apple fruit. It's leesy and textural, tasting of wet stones: in sum, a wonderfully refreshing summer white."
Hugh Hamilton 2020 The Scally Wag Chardonnay (McLaren Vale),Hugh Hamilton,White,The Scally Wag,Chardonnay,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",13%,$16,86,Christina Pickard,"There's a lot of winemaking here. The nose is fruity, with peach and strawberry notes backed by ginger, cream and some oak influence. There's also what seems like a good lick of sulfur. In the mouth, acidity is angular and feels forced. The wine has a slippery texture and plenty of zippy fruit but again, the sulfur shows and the finish is a touch sour."
Gabriel Meffre 2005 La Chasse du Pape Prestige Red (Côtes du Rhône),Gabriel Meffre,Red,La Chasse du Pape Prestige,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Côtes du Rhône, Rhône Valley, France",,$10,83,Joe Czerwinski,"A quaffable if somewhat innocuous Côtes-du-Rhône with modest cherry fruit. The blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and the remainder Cinsault and Mourvèdre is medium-bodied, then thins out a bit on the finish."
Anselmo Mendes 2017 Curtimenta Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),Anselmo Mendes,White,Curtimenta,"Alvarinho, Albariño","Vinho Verde, Portugal",13%,$38,94,Roger Voss,"Lightly wood-aged Alvarinho has an inspired balance between freshness and a rich, open spicy character. The carefully judged wood brings out the natural creaminess of the variety, while keeping plenty of freshness and citrus flavors. Drink now."
Shingleback 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),Shingleback,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$20,88,Joe Czerwinski,"Shingleback's 2009 displays the hallmarks of South Australian Cabernet: cassis, chocolate and mint notes and plenty of weight on the palate. The tannins are a little coarse, but that will only help the wine in the context of a steak dinner."
Tenuta di Fessina 2014 Laeneo Nerello Cappuccio (Sicilia),Tenuta di Fessina,Red,Laeneo,"Nerello Cappuccio, Italian Red","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",,$25,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made entirely with Nerello Cappuccio, this reveals aromas of raspberry compote, tilled earth, ripe berry and grilled herb. The juicy palate delivers fleshy black cherry, licorice, white pepper and a hint of sage alongside bright acidity and smooth tannins. It's already accessible. Drink through 2019."
Charles Smith 2014 Broncho Stoneridge Vineyard Malbec (Washington),Charles Smith,Red,Broncho Stoneridge Vineyard,Malbec,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",14%,$70,91,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas erupt from the glass, with notes of potpourri, orange peel, moist earth, stem and garden herb. The palate shows a pleasing mix of earth and savory flavors that deliver a lot of elegance and intertwine effortlessly through the finish. The variety seems a bit hard to find but the expression is quite intriguing."
Solminer 2018 Linus Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley),Solminer,Rose,Linus,Rosé,"Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",12.2%,$28,91,Matt Kettmann,"Crisp aromas of red apple, light raspberry, rose petal and a hint of chalk make for an intriguing nose on this Grenache-based rosé. The palate is tense and acid driven, offering flavors of cherry and light cola spice."
Bouchaine 2009 Bacchus Collection Estate Vineyard Pinot Meunier (Carneros),Bouchaine,Red,Bacchus Collection Estate Vineyard,"Pinot Meunier, Other Red","Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$40,85,,"A tough wine to like. It's bone dry, hard in tannins and tartly acidic, and not very fruity, with flavors just barely suggesting sour cherries. On the plus side is elegant construction."
Nos Riqueza 2003 9 Meses  (Ribera del Duero),Nos Riqueza,Red,9 Meses,"Tinto del Pais, Tempranillo","Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$33,88,Michael Schachner,"A little peppery and lean, but time unleashes more heft, char and fruit than what's initially evident. In the mouth, it's full of plump berry and cherry notes, and maybe a touch of raisin (2003 was a hot year). Not the most agile, finesse-based red but still very good."
Albert Bichot 2007 Domaine du Clos Frantin Clos de Vougeot  (Clos de Vougeot),Albert Bichot,Red,Domaine du Clos Frantin Clos de Vougeot,Pinot Noir,"Clos de Vougeot, Burgundy, France",13.5%,,92,Roger Voss,"There is power here, but it is hidden behind an exterior of sweet fruit. The black plum juice freshness fronts dark, dry tannins, a core of steel. The ripe fruit is already delicious, but those tannins shows this dense wine's aging potential."
Haka by Labyrinth 2010 Freebird Red (Paso Robles),Haka by Labyrinth,Red,Freebird,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$22,89,Matt Kettmann,"This blend of Merlot and Tempranillo, with touches of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon, opens with notes of warm cherry pie, black tobacco and cedar. Fresh boysenberry starts the palate, with mouthwatering spice in the midpalate and mocha on the finish."
Burmester NV 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port),Burmester,Port/Sherry,10-Year-Old Tawny,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,$26,91,Roger Voss,"This dry, mature wine tastes older than a 10-Year-Old, with complex wood aging, spirit and acidity that have taken over from the fruitiness. It is serious and structured."
Spangler Vineyards 2006 Cabernet Franc (Southern Oregon),Spangler Vineyards,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"Southern Oregon, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",,$24,82,Paul Gregutt,"Chewy, earthy and tannic, this rather awkward wine matches cranberry and black cherry hard candy fruit to a rough, stemmy underbelly. There is some leather and barnyard in the middle; all in all it's a bit of a rough ride."
Château de Cornemps 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),Château de Cornemps,Rose,,Rosé,"Bordeaux Rosé, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$12,84,Roger Voss,"Ripe and smooth, this is rich with red berries. A touch of pepper accompanies a zesty texture that backs up the fruitiness. Drink now."
Carol Shelton 2019 Wild Thing Rendezvous Rosé (Mendocino County),Carol Shelton,Rose,Wild Thing Rendezvous,Rosé,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",13.5%,$17,86,Jim Gordon,"A bright, deep-pink color and intense candied fruit aromas make this medium-bodied wine dramatic to sip. An edgy raspberry vein takes over the finish."
Allimant-Laugner 2018 Pinot Gris (Alsace),Allimant-Laugner,White,,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$18,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Generous ripeness is already apparent on the juicy, almost tropically inflected notes of pear on the nose of this wine. Juicy, mellow and fresh, the palate comes with creaminess that accentuates the richness. The finish is off dry and mellow."
Spy Valley 2016 Hand Picked Single Estate Chardonnay (Marlborough),Spy Valley,White,Hand Picked Single Estate,Chardonnay,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13%,$20,86,Christina Pickard,"Aromas of onion mask prettier nuances of citrus, grapefruit and toast on the nose. It's slippery with tingly acidity on the palate, but the fruit seems somewhat sour and the toasty oak flavors at the finish throw off the wine's balance a little."
Chateau Faire Le Pont 2004 Provence Red (Washington),Chateau Faire Le Pont,Red,Provence,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$29,85,Paul Gregutt,"Despite excellent vineyard sources, this is overripe for my palate, with flavors that are pruney and soft, and lacking definition and authority. It's soft and mysteriously weightless, with figgy fruit and a quick finish."
Rideau 2003 Iris' Estate Bon Temps Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),Rideau,Red,Iris' Estate Bon Temps Vineyard,,"Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",16.4%,$55,87,,"Combines an intensely pepery note with dense plum-cake fruit and elevated (16.4%) alcohol, yet remains appealing thanks to a full, rich mouthfeel and supple tannins. The plum, dried spice and pepper flavors mostly obscure the high alcohol, leading to a long, spicy finish."
Scriani 2008  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Scriani,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Amarone della Valpolicella Classico, Veneto, Italy",16%,$35,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Earthy aromas of tilled soil, meat juices and blackberry are accompanied by flavors of black cherry and nutmeg. The palate is already evolved and shows tertiary aromas, with a slight warmth throughout, so drink over the next few years."
Serenity 2012 Mirth Red (Finger Lakes),Serenity,Red,Mirth,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12%,$24,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Equal proportions of Cabernet Franc and Merlot yield this penetrating sour-cherry palate touched with nuts, smoke, bramble and herb. It's refreshingly light bodied, marked by a crush of cranberry acidity and finely grained tannins."
Leth 2012 Scheiben Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland),Leth,White,Scheiben,Grüner Veltliner,"Wagram-Donauland, Austria",13.5%,$35,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Aromatically subtle but ripe notes of yellow pear match the creamy mouthfeel, which has a pleasantly pebbly undertone and soft, almost cushioned acidity."

Iijima,"Earthen notes of honeycomb, pollen and stone accent pristine lemon and lime in this dry, slightly savory Riesling. It's a zesty, peppery wine that's invigorating and spry on the palate. Enjoy now through 2021."
Saints Hills 2010 Sv Roko Plavac Mali (Neretvansko Vinogorje),Saints Hills,Red,Sv Roko,"Plavac Mali, Other Red",,14.4%,$29,89,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Bright red cherry and plum flavors are cloaked in layers of chocolate, leather and dried herbs on this lush, luxurious Plavac Mali. The palate is deeply penetrating with ripe black fruit, and a tannic structure that builds in density towards the finish. Soft floral notes add a feminine flair."
Zeni 2018 Vignealte  (Lugana),Zeni,White,Vignealte,"Turbiana, Italian White","Lugana, Lombardy, Italy",13.5%,$15,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Enticingly delicate scents of peach blossom, white stone fruit and wild herb mingle with whiffs of almond on this vibrant white. The bright savory palate shows Granny Smith apple, grapefruit, pineapple and a saline mineral note alongside crisp acidity."

Sullivan,"This wine is a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Aromas of wood spice, herbs, black fruit and flowers lead to a full bodied palate with dark chocolate and cherry flavors, showing a lovely sense of balance."
Quinta do Passadouro 2008 Passadouro Reserva Red (Douro),Quinta do Passadouro,Red,Passadouro Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",14.5%,,93,Roger Voss,"From Passadouro's old vines, this is serious, complex wine. Its fruit is an integral part of the dark tannic structure, adding to the gentle power. It has spice as well as juicy fruit, wood and, on the finish, sweet fruit flavors."
Chateau La Tour Carnet 2005  Bordeaux Blanc,Chateau La Tour Carnet,White,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Bordeaux Blanc, Bordeaux, France",13%,$65,89,Roger Voss,"A spicy, nutty wine, with fresh white fruits and some richness.

Domaine Jessiaume 2014 Les Cent Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Domaine Jessiaume,Red,Les Cent Vignes Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Beaune, Burgundy, France",13%,$47,92,Roger Voss,"This rich wine has spice and red fruits backed by a dry texture. The smoky wood is still right up front, giving the wine a firm character. Wait for the fruit to develop further and drink from 2020."
Gebeshuber 2013 Große Reserve Red (Thermenregion),Gebeshuber,Red,Große Reserve,"Red Blends, Red Blends","$30,Buy Now",13.5%,$30,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Notes of crushed berries on polished mahogany come to mind. This is elegant and classic, its strucure is firm but not imposing, the tone is one of subtlety and elegance. This stands straight and presents honest, dark fruit and leaves with a long, velvety train of spiced berry, more mahogany and a touch of forest floor Very alluring."
Château Laville Haut-Brion 2002  Pessac-Léognan,Château Laville Haut-Brion,White,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,$135,93,Roger Voss,"This small estate, dedicated to white wines only, is part of the same stable as Château Haut-Brion itself. This superb wine is packed with ripe, sweet fruit, but equally importantly, shows intensity, layers of wood, a great citrus character and the acidity so typical of 2002. This is a long-term wine: drink in 10–15 years."
Montirius 2000  Gigondas,Montirius,Red,,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Gigondas, Rhône Valley, France",,$28,91,Roger Voss,"A hugely rich wine, from a biodynamic vineyard; it will be immensely long-lived. Its sweet fruit contrasts with brooding tannins and intense herbal essences. Drink this in 10 years."

McClelland,Red,,Merlot,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.7%,$35,88,Virginie Boone,"Blended with 14% Cabernet Franc, this succeeds in its light-bodied palate of red currant, cranberry and plum, with secondary characteristics of pencil shavings and graphite. The midpalate is thick and concentrated, finishing with elegance."
Strange Family Vineyards 2015 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Strange Family Vineyards,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.7%,$35,89,Matt Kettmann,"Dried cherry, stewed mulberry, orange peel and Christmas spices play on the nose of this bottling. Extracted flavors of dried red plums, fig and a hint of raisin are lifted by bay leaf and eucalyptus on the tangy palate."
Korbel 2009 Made with Organically Grown Grapes Brut Sparkling (California),Korbel,Sparkling,Made with Organically Grown Grapes Brut,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","California, California Other, California, US",12%,VivinoGary's Wine,86,,"A sweetly delicious bubbly, with fine bubbles and a rich yeastiness to the citrus, cherry and vanilla flavors. The blend is of French Colombard, Chardonnay and Sangiovese."
Hanzell 2015 Day Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),Hanzell,White,Day Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$78,94,Virginie Boone,"Entirely stainless-steel fermented and oak aged—the oak neutral—this is a formidably memorable wine, fulsome and balanced in anise and juicy Gravenstein apple and peach. On the palate it's lush and creamy, with supportive acidity maintaining welcome, lasting freshness."
V. Sattui 2016 Chardonnay (Los Carneros),V. Sattui,White,,Chardonnay,"Los Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.8%,$44,90,Virginie Boone,"Spicy in honeyed oak, this full-bodied wine is bright in acidity and strong flavors of lime and lemon verbena. Balanced and integrated despite its complete embrace of ripeness, it allows for a brightness of acidity beneath grainy texture and grip."
Ulrich Langguth 2014 Piesporter Günterslay Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),Ulrich Langguth,White,Piesporter Günterslay Kabinett,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",9%,$22,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While rich and almost nectar like in ripeness, this vibrantly peachy, floral wine is kept in check by an exhilarating strike of lime acidity. Off dry in style, it's concentrated and penetrating, yet bracingly sheer. It would be a showstopper apéritif at the most elegant cocktail party."
Maison Bouey 2011 Château Belrose  (Bordeaux Supérieur),Maison Bouey,Red,Château Belrose,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux Supérieur, Bordeaux, France",,$15,89,Roger Voss,"Solid and textured, this is a firm wine with a bright future. It has weight from its tannins as well as ripe berry fruits that shine through. Delicate acidity lightens the load. It does need to age, so drink from 2016."
Montresor 2006 Castelliere delle Guaite  (Valpolicella Ripasso Classico),Montresor,Red,Castelliere delle Guaite,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara, Italian Red","Valpolicella Ripasso Classico, Veneto, Italy",14.5%,$31,88,,"This is a very intense and compelling Ripasso with bright tones of currant berry and blackberry that rise above a spicy base of cinnamon, chocolate and dried tobacco. The wine is smooth and soft although it finishes with power and determination."
Porcupine Ridge 2006 Syrah (Coastal Region),Porcupine Ridge,Red,,,"$13,Buy Now",14.5%,$13,84,Susan Kostrzewa,"A full, rich nose of blackberry, cinnamon and black pepper introduces this impressive Shiraz from mover and shaker Marc Kent.

M. Chapoutier 2015 Collection Bio  (Cornas),M. Chapoutier,Red,Collection Bio,,"Cornas, Rhône Valley, France",13.5%,,93,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Made from organic grapes, this is a seductively perfumed Syrah shaded by savory tones of smoked meat, cacao and sun-dried herbs. Pristine black-fruit flavors are powerfully concentrated yet briskly balanced, framed by a grip of raspy tannins and vibrant acidity. It's a lovely wine to enjoy now through 2030."
Louis Jadot 2016  Clos de Vougeot,Louis Jadot,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Clos de Vougeot, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$238,96,Roger Voss,"Jadot is one of about 80 owners of tiny parcels in this walled, five-acre vineyard. This wine is as much about rich, generous opulence as about structure. An ethereal fragrance moves into the powerful black fruits and velvet tannins. The wine will develop slowly and surely, ready to drink from 2027."
Bucci 2012  Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore,Bucci,White,,"Verdicchio, Italian White","Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore, Central Italy, Italy",13.5%,$22,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"This classic bottling opens with enticing floral aromas of Spanish broom, acacia and a whiff of flint. The palate delivers succulent yellow peach, citrus and almond along with mineral notes. It boasts impeccable balance and nice length."
Wine & Soul 2010 Manoella Red (Douro),Wine & Soul,Red,Manoella,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",14%,$22,92,Roger Voss,"A big, powerful, fruity wine, this is laden with dry tannins as well as blackberry flavor. Dark and concentrated, it has a solid, dense feel with fruits layered with intense wood notes. It needs at least five years to soften and round out."
Trénel 2018  Saint-Véran,Trénel,White,,Chardonnay,"Saint-Véran, Burgundy, France",13%,$33,88,Roger Voss,Spicy aromas give this wine a contrast between fruit and nutty flavors. The texture is balanced by hints of tropical fruits at the end. Drink from 2020.
McGregor 2006 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),McGregor,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12.5%,$28,80,,This wine falls short of its rather lofty ambitions with lavish new French oak treatment resulting in a diminished fruit profile. Sawdust notes dominate the nose while the faintest hint of cherry can be detected on the palate. Finishes a bit tart. A good choice for those hankering for a vanilla milkshake.
Alamos 2014 Torrontés (Mendoza),Alamos,White,,Torrontés,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13%,$13,84,Michael Schachner,"This is fragrant and varietally-correct on the nose. Quince, lemon-lime and lychee flavors show their best right away before turning decidedly sweet on the finish."
Château du Basty 2019  Morgon,Château du Basty,Red,,Gamay,"Morgon, Beaujolais, France",13%,$28,89,Roger Voss,"Attractively perfumed and also with firm, young tannins, this wine has density and signs of wood aging. It is still young and coming together. Drink from 2022."
Chaleur Estate 2006 Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA)),Chaleur Estate,White,Blanc,White Blend,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.5%,$34,94,Paul Gregutt,"Rich and smoky, this Sauvignon Blanc-Sémillon blend delivers a nose suggesting golden raisins, ripe figs, white peaches and light streaks of butter, honey and caramel. The fruit and wood are balanced and the alcohol is a moderate 13.5%. Everything here is in proportion, layered, smooth and seductive. More than past vintages, this is a Chaleur blanc that seems destined to age and develop over the next decade or more."
Château de Tourteyron 2011  Médoc,Château de Tourteyron,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Médoc, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,,85,Roger Voss,"A firm and tannic wine, it is still developing. The dry structure and the smoky wood aging are dominant, giving a hard feel. It does have a juicy hint underneath, so the fruit will develop although tannins are going to remain prominent."
Château Belles Eaux 2015 Les Coteaux White (Languedoc),Château Belles Eaux,White,Les Coteaux,White Blend,"Languedoc, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",13%,$16,85,Lauren Buzzeo,"Pretty, light aromas of green melon rind, lime leaf, thyme, clover and just-dried grass dance on the nose of this white blend. The palate offers even less intensity, with a faint green-melon flavor and a thin yet clean mouthfeel. Drink now."
Starfield 2016 Marsanne (El Dorado),Starfield,White,,Marsanne,"El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.6%,$24,91,Jim Gordon,"Ripe and fruity, this full-bodied wine brims with melon and tangerine aromas and almost-sweet peach and melon flavors. It wraps them in a soothing, rich texture that encourages a long finish."
Vega Moragona 2010 Tempranillo (Ribera del Júcar),Vega Moragona,Red,,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Júcar, Central Spain, Spain",14.5%,$12,85,Michael Schachner,"Ripe blueberry, black plum and violet aromas are sweet and ripe. This is a chunky, flat feeling Tempranillo with candied, soft blackberry and other black-fruit flavors. A short, simple finish fits this heavy wine's overall profile."
Fall Creek 2012 Salt Lick Vineyards Tempranillo (Texas),Fall Creek,Red,Salt Lick Vineyards,Tempranillo,"Texas, Texas, US",14.5%,$30,86,Alexander Peartree,"Smoky and savory on the nose, stewed blueberries mix with sweet barbecue sauce aromas. The palate shows fresher black fruit supported by grainy tannins."
Huntington 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),Huntington,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$14,87,,"Sometimes you just need a tasty, inexpensive Sauvignon Blanc to wash down almost anything, and here you go. It's dryish and zesty in acidity, with white currant, green grass and tropical fruit flavors that are rich enough to accompany grilled salmon. Grows more interesting as you sip."
Bodega San Pedro Regalado 2008 Embocadero  (Ribera del Duero),Bodega San Pedro Regalado,Red,Embocadero,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$18,85,Michael Schachner,"Broad, dark and meaty, with aromas of leather and beef broth. The palate comes on as bulky and tannic, but the flavors are full and deep even if they are also a touch soupy and meaty. Good for a 2008 midlevel RDD, but nothing to get excited over."
Drouhin Oregon Roserock 2015 Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills),Drouhin Oregon Roserock,White,,Chardonnay,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.9%,$35,93,Paul Gregutt,"This hits the palate with full force—a stylish effort that coats the tongue with lush stone fruit flavors, elevated with citrus-tinged acidity. A light touch of barrel toast frames the lovely fruit. Drink now through the mid-2020s."
Terra Andina 2008 Altos Red (Central Valley),Terra Andina,Red,Altos,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Central Valley, Chile",14%,$18,87,Michael Schachner,"Jammy and lush smelling, yet more racy, acidic and flashy in the mouth. Flavors of cherry and raspberry are saturated and dense, but the feel is kind of hard and narrow. Minty and a little warm on the finish. 70% Malbec and 30% Petit Verdot."
Clos de la Coulée de Serrant 2002 Clos de la Coulée de Serrant  (Savennières-Coulée de Serrant),Clos de la Coulée de Serrant,White,Clos de la Coulée de Serrant,Chenin Blanc,"Savennières-Coulée de Serrant, Loire Valley, France",,$79,95,Roger Voss,"Nicolas Joly and his mother are possessors of the smallest appellation in France: Coulée de Serrant. This almost vertical vineyard, dropping down to the Loire, facing due south, makes a mythical wine that is powerful and laden with exotic fruit flavors: oranges, lemon, apricots, accented with spices and the tannins of a youthful white wine. This will last for decades. Imported by Vintus."
Vinadeis 2016 Le Val Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),Vinadeis,White,Le Val,Sauvignon Blanc,"Vin de France, France Other, France",12.5%,$12,84,Roger Voss,"This warm style of Sauvignon Blanc has easygoing acidity and gooseberry fruit flavors. It's lightly tangy, with a bright, crisp texture."
Chehalem 2019 Grüner Veltliner (Ribbon Ridge),Chehalem,White,,Grüner Veltliner,"Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",12.3%,$30,85,Paul Gregutt,"The slightly tawny straw color suggests incipient oxidation, and the wine's flatness in the mouth confirms it. The vivid, peppery quality for which the grape is known is nowhere evident. The flavors are autumnal, like apples just past the point of optimal ripeness, so this wine should be consumed as soon as possible."
Arista 2013 Toboni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Arista,Red,Toboni Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$64,93,Virginie Boone,"From a longtime vineyard source, this wine opens with dried herb and menthol aromas. It's exotic on the palate too, with seductive, silky-smooth texture and a tightness of acidity. Black cherry meets black tea and pomegranate, with just the slightest remembrance of cola. Drink now through 2023."
Di Lenardo 2007 Vigneto Vigne da Lis Maris Chardonnay (Friuli Grave),Di Lenardo,White,Vigneto Vigne da Lis Maris,Chardonnay,"Friuli Grave, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13%,$10,87,,"This luminous wine has a smooth, creamy quality that is reinforced by generous aromas of pineapple, citrus, peach and a dot of vanilla. It tastes fruity and fresh, but doesn't lack in structure, and would pair well with mushroom risotto."
Margarida Cabaco 2001 Monte dos Cabacos Red (Alentejano),Margarida Cabaco,Red,Monte dos Cabacos,Portuguese Red,"Alentejano, Portugal",14%,$19,84,Joe Czerwinski,"Like many of the Alentejano wines, this one is a blend of several grape varieties. In this case, it's Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Touriga Nacional and Alicante Bouschet. The result is a broad, mouthfilling wine but one that lacks depth or richness. Black cherry and leather flavors are pleasant enough for washing down weeknight burgers. Imported by Vinum International."
Domaine Chignard 2006 Cuvée Spéciale  (Fleurie),Domaine Chignard,Red,Cuvée Spéciale,Gamay,"Fleurie, Beaujolais, France",,$25,92,Roger Voss,"There's an explosion of rich, intense fruit here: dried prunes, black plums and even some licorice. The wine is attractively edged with wood, giving a fine, ripe finish."
Kemblefield 2004 Winemakers Signature Chardonnay (Hawke's Bay),Kemblefield,White,Winemakers Signature,Chardonnay,"Hawke's Bay, New Zealand",,$13,87,Joe Czerwinski,"Fruit-forward, with green apple and lime aromas that are rounded out on the palate by a bit of peach. Light to medium in body, this fresh, crisp Chardonnay picks up citrusy notes on the finish. Imported by Total Beverage Solution."
Château Lafleur-Gazin 2014 Barrel Sample  (Pomerol),Château Lafleur-Gazin,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pomerol, Bordeaux, France",,,92,Roger Voss,"91–93. Barrel Sample. Structured and firm, this wine has dark, concentrated tannins counterbalanced with plenty of freshest acidity. This composition shows promise for good aging."
Ojai 2005 Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),Ojai,Red,Thompson Vineyard,,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$45,91,,"So lush and soft, so delicious, you have to drink it right now. Shows impeccably dry, complex flavors of blackberries, cherries and cedar, with roasted meat, sassafras, spice and dried herb notes. Great with lamb."
Clos des Menuts 2015  Saint-Émilion,Clos des Menuts,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",14%,$29,90,Roger Voss,"This rich and dense wine shines with ripe Merlot, a product of the warm vintage. Dusty tannins, licorice and black-fruit flavors and plenty of spice from wood aging all contribute to the generally ripe effect of this generous wine. Drink from 2023."
Mirabeau en Provence 2020 Belle Année Rosé (Vin de France),Mirabeau en Provence,Rose,Belle Année,Rosé,"Vin de France, France Other, France",12.5%,$14,86,Roger Voss,"This wine is all fruit, with bright red-berry and red-currant flavors.

Two Sisters 2016 Lindsay's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Two Sisters,Red,Lindsay's Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$75,93,Matt Kettmann,"Aromas of rose petal, mulberry and violet make for an intriguing entry to this bottling. It's a smooth style of Pinot Noir, with soft tannins and a rich mouthfeel that carries flavors of violet and boysenberry."
Besserat de Bellefon NV BB Blanc de Noirs Grand Cru Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Besserat de Bellefon,Sparkling,BB Blanc de Noirs Grand Cru Brut,Pinot Noir,"Champagne, Champagne, France",12.5%,$90,93,Roger Voss,"With its 100% Pinot Noir from grand cru vineyards, this Champagne has great richness and good structure. Freshness balances with the strong mineral texture that gives the wine a tight edge. Drink the bottling from late 2021."
J. Lohr 2018 Pure Paso Proprietary Red (Paso Robles),J. Lohr,Red,Pure Paso Proprietary,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$27,93,Matt Kettmann,"This blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Petite Sirah, 2% Syrah and 2% Malbec offers aromas of black-cherry pie, toasty brioche and fresh mint on the nose. That minty element carries to the palate, where more black cherry and fudge flavors are wrapped in ample acidity and chalky tannins."
Greywacke 2011 Wild Sauvignon Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Greywacke,White,Wild Sauvignon,Sauvignon Blanc,"Marlborough, New Zealand",14%,$29,92,Joe Czerwinski,"Full bodied and lushly textured, this is not a typical Marlborough Sauvignon. On the nose, there's a restrained smoky character and some grapefruit, while the plate bursts with lovely pink grapefruit and some understated leafiness. It's all brought together by a balanced, harmonious finish."
Sarah's Vineyard 2015 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Clara Valley),Sarah's Vineyard,Red,Estate,Pinot Noir,"Santa Clara Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.2%,$45,92,Matt Kettmann,"Red cherry, rust, cinnamon, vanilla and wet herbs make for a crisp and compelling nose on this bottling by winemaker Tim Slater, who manages to elicit cooler climate properties from a warmer region. A wide array of herbs, including thyme, oregano, marjoram and sage, decorate the firmly structured hibiscus, red currant and cranberry backdrop. The acid goes deep into the finish."
Cono Sur 2008 Organically Grown Grapes Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),Cono Sur,Red,Organically Grown Grapes,,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",13%,$13,84,Michael Schachner,"Hard and inky on first blush, with aromas of shoe polish and wild, aggressive fruit. A far more narrow and acidic wine than we expected to find, with racy, short, blue fruit flavors. Bright and choppy, with a short finish. Seems underdeveloped."
Vallformosa 2000 Mas La Roca Selección Especial Syrah (Penedès),Vallformosa,Red,Mas La Roca Selección Especial,,"Penedès, Catalonia, Spain",13.5%,$30,83,Michael Schachner,"Dark and smoky, almost like a burnt wooden match on top of plum purée. Runs a bit tart in the mouth for Syrah, with red raspberry and cherry flavors. Firm and lean in the mouth."
Brick House NV House Red Made with Biodynamic Grapes Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),Brick House,Red,House Red Made with Biodynamic Grapes,Pinot Noir,"Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",12.5%,$29,91,Paul Gregutt,"The fire-impacted 2020 vintage led founder Doug Tunnell to declassify all the fruit and create this blend, which includes a significant portion of 2019 juice. The winner here is you, the consumer. Delicious blackberry fruit, hints of coffee and chocolate, smooth tannins and a lush mouthfeel make this immediately enjoyable."
Kevin White 2015 DuBrul Vineyard Red (Yakima Valley),Kevin White,Red,DuBrul Vineyard,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$40,92,Sean P. Sullivan,"Coming from one of the state's top vineyards, this wine is a blend of Merlot (52%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. The aromas pop, with achingly pure notes of raspberry, assorted dried herb, pie cherry, blueberry and spice. The palate shows finesse and grace, with silky fruit flavors and velvety tannins, with savory notes on a finish that won't quit. It's a flat-out gorgeous, exquisitely understated interpretation of this vineyard."
Henri de Villamont 2015 Sous le Puits Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),Henri de Villamont,White,Sous le Puits Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Puligny-Montrachet, Burgundy, France",13.5%,,93,Roger Voss,"This naturally cool vineyard fared well in warm 2015, giving wine that has retained minerality and a crisp texture. It is fruity, while having a tight edge as well as layers of acidity. Drink from 2020."
Villa Monteleone 2009 Campo Santa Lena  (Valpolicella Classico),Villa Monteleone,Red,Campo Santa Lena,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara, Italian Red","Valpolicella Classico, Veneto, Italy",12%,$13,83,,"Easy on the nose and mouth, offering simple aromas of cherry, blueberry and white almond. In the mouth, it delivers an informal, lean approach."
Carol Shelton 2019 Coquille Rouge Red (Central Coast),Carol Shelton,Red,Coquille Rouge,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$26,91,Matt Kettmann,"Living legend Carol Shelton sources from the town of Oakley in the San Joaquin Delta region for this blend of Carignan, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Alicante Bouschet and Petite Sirah. Oaky aromas of vanilla, dark berry and violet lead into a palate of cola, sarsaparilla, cinnamon and baked strawberry flavors."
Torremoron 2009 Tempranillo  (Ribera del Duero),Torremoron,Red,Tempranillo,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$11,86,Michael Schachner,"A little earthy and rough at first, with rubbery aromas. After time it evolves to deliver a weighty palate full of black fruit, oak and medicinality. Dry, toasty and a bit hot and scratchy on the finish. Nice for $11 Ribera del Duero."
Korbel NV Sweet Cuvée Sparkling (California),Korbel,Sparkling,Sweet Cuvée,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","California, California Other, California, US",11%,$13,87,,"Like the label suggests, it's sugary in tangerine, vanilla cookie and butterscotch flavors, with crisp acidity and fine, scoury bubbles. A nice sparkling wine for those who like a sweeter style."
Vivác Winery 2009 Tempranillo (New Mexico),Vivác Winery,Red,,Tempranillo,"New Mexico, New Mexico, US",13%,$20,83,,"This smells like a melted Luden's cough drop sprinkled with coffee grounds and spices. Medium bodied, it has a jumbled herbal flavor, finishing with warmth and notes of dark chocolate and coffee."
Bailly-Lapierre 2013 Vive-la-Joie Rosé Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),Bailly-Lapierre,Sparkling,Vive-la-Joie Rosé Brut,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Crémant de Bourgogne, Burgundy, France",12%,$33,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Strawberry shortcake notes abound on the fresh nose of this wine, which conveys the fresh fruit, creaminess and richness of the pastry. The palate puts these all in a tight, fresh corset, vivid with liveliness. Fine foam makes everything exuberant and bright. The finish is alluring and dry."
Château Clairac 2013  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,Château Clairac,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",,$14,85,Roger Voss,"This lightly oaked wine is already balanced with some attractive dusty tannins and red currant fruit flavors. It is bright with acidity and with a fresh, fruity aftertaste. Drink from 2016. This is a Carreau family estate."
Maison Bleue 2007 La Vallée du Soleil Roussanne (Yakima Valley),Maison Bleue,White,La Vallée du Soleil,Roussanne,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$23,86,Paul Gregutt,"This reverses the blend of the Viognier; it's 85% Roussanne and 15% Viognier and finishes in a rather surprisingly sweet, off-dry style with 1.4% residual sugar. White peach and spicy pear fruit flavors are bright and fleshy, while the sweetness is offset by moderate acids. For those who prefer some sweetness in their white wines, this is an excellent choice."
Schäfer-Fröhlich 2017 Kabinett Riesling (Nahe),Schäfer-Fröhlich,White,Kabinett,Riesling,"Nahe, Germany",8%,$39,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Earthen notes of crushed mineral and bramble juxtapose lip-smacking lemon, lime and white grapefruit here. It's a spine-tingling, piercing wine edged by delicate hints of sweetness and a pleasantly savory, salty finish. It needs more time to open but is structured enough to improve through 2035."

This is soft on the palate, without a lot of spine or structure. Earthy, herbal flavors of stewed berries, tomato and green herbs finish minty and leafy, but with good feel."
La Forge Estate 2008 Unfiltered Merlot (Vin de Pays d'Oc),La Forge Estate,Red,Unfiltered,Merlot,"Vin de Pays d'Oc, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",13.5%,$13,83,Lauren Buzzeo,"The bright and inviting nose is loaded with lively red fruit, including raspberries and cherries, along with a soft hint of vanilla.

Iijima,"Just a hint of sweet mesquite lends spice on the nose of this juicy, bright-fruited Chardonnay. Medium bodied and plump in yellow apple, pear and Mirabelle flavors, it's a fruit-forward, elegant sip best enjoyed young."
:Nota Bene 2008 Abbinare Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),:Nota Bene,Red,Abbinare,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.9%,$25,91,Paul Gregutt,"A rich and smooth vintage for Abbinare, once again a Bordeaux-style blend that is half Merlot, and roughly 20% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Purple fruits are swathed in milk-chocolaty tannins. It's full, firm, dense and immediately appealing, with aftertastes suggesting graphite and vanilla."
Château Pertignas 2016 Cuvée de Copains  (Bordeaux Supérieur),Château Pertignas,Red,Cuvée de Copains,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux Supérieur, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$23,84,Roger Voss,"This wine holds fruit that was too ripe, giving a clumsy character. It has structure as well as bright acidity, but the wine is spoiled by the jamminess."
Sanfeletto NV Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),Sanfeletto,Sparkling,Brut,"Glera, Italian White","Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore, Veneto, Italy",11.5%,$19,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Delicate aromas of Spanish broom and pear come with a hint of nuts on the nose. The palate offers yellow peach, green apple and a mineral note alongside vibrant acidity and small, persistent bubbles."
Golan Heights Winery 2014 Yarden Sauvignon Blanc (Galilee),Golan Heights Winery,White,Yarden,Sauvignon Blanc,"Galilee, Israel",13.5%,$20,89,Mike DeSimone,"Light straw to the eye, this wine offers aromas of pineapple, grapefruit and cut grass.

Big Daddy Vineyards 2003 Chardonnay (Mendoza),Big Daddy Vineyards,White,,Chardonnay,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.3%,$9,82,Michael Schachner,"Heavy and flat, with dull apple aromas. The palate delivers simple yellow fruit, while the finish is soft and devoid of spunk. There isn't a whole lot more to say about this wine; it's a cipher."

Bold fistfuls of Asian spice give it complexity and balance."
Sartarelli 2008 Balciana  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore),Sartarelli,White,Balciana,"Verdicchio, Italian White","Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore, Central Italy, Italy",15%,,88,,"Light golden in color, this has ripe aromas of stone fruit, apricot, honey, grapefruit and dried herb.

Skinner 2019 Mourvèdre (El Dorado),Skinner,Red,,Mourvèdre,"El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",13.5%,$30,92,Jim Gordon,"This handsomely oaked wine sprinkles ginger, cinnamon and clove over ripe and vibrant black-cherry flavors that are wrapped in moderate tannins for a grippy mouthfeel. Tempting now for its warm spices and deep fruit, it will be best from 2024."
Frei Brothers 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Frei Brothers,Red,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.3%,$27,86,,"This treads the line between simple and complex, showing ripe flavors of blackberries and cherries that seem sweet, although the finish is dry. Softly tannic, this is made for drinking now."

The wine is as smooth as silk, like honey gliding over the palate, carrying lime, grapefuit, peach and raspberry flavors. A certain softness may limit ageability, so drink now."
Errazuriz 2005 Don Maximiano Founder's Reserva Red (Aconcagua Valley),Errazuriz,Red,Don Maximiano Founder's Reserva,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Aconcagua Valley, Chile",14.5%,$65,90,Michael Schachner,"The best Don Max in quite some time. After too many herbal-green vintages, the 2005 is ripe, rich and well woven. The bouquet shows hickory, roasted plum, chocolate, vanilla and peanut. The palate, meanwhile, is all about pure cassis, blackberry, mocha and spice. Finishes with a dash of caramel and earthy fruit leftovers. Honest, rugged and ready, but ageable for at least another 3–4 years."
Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 1996 Réserve Brut  (Champagne),Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,Sparkling,Réserve Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$75,90,Paul Gregutt,"This is a gem, with lots of up-front toast. A typical  structured year for Champagne, this has clean, round fruit, but retains good acid, providing firm support and longer-term aging potential than the '95. It floats into a pleasing, vanilla cream and toast finish."
Indigo Hills 2000 Chardonnay (Central Coast),Indigo Hills,White,,Chardonnay,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",,$12,83,,"Dust and earth aromas cover underlying apple flavors in this simple, rather sweet wine. Excessively soft acidity makes it drink syrupy. Still, it has basic Chard features and will satisfy most big crowds. —S.H."

Simon Gilbert 2004 Central Ranges Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (New South Wales),Simon Gilbert,White,Central Ranges,"Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc, White Blend","New South Wales, New South Wales, Australia",12%,$15,85,,"What we get of this Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc is nice, but there's just not enough of it to go around. Mineral and green grape flavors fade into fresh herbs on the palate, but the flavors are less than intense. Peach skin and grass aromas are joined by some rubber on the nose. Has potential; just wants to be dialed up a little louder."
Hayward by Folin Cellars 2012 Utopia Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),Hayward by Folin Cellars,Red,Utopia Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.2%,$45,92,Paul Gregutt,"This is winemaker Rob Folin's side project, sourcing grapes from the excellent Utopia Vineyard in the heart of the Willamette Valley. It captures the elegance, precision and depth of that specific location. Toasty, spicy and focused, it's structured around bright, deep raspberry and Bing cherry fruit. The lush baking spices are the perfect frame."
Faiveley 2005 Les Mauvarennes  (Mercurey),Faiveley,Red,Les Mauvarennes,Pinot Noir,"Mercurey, Burgundy, France",13%,$25,89,Roger Voss,"Dark and tough, this shows considerable wood at this early stage. Like many Faiveley wines, it is tough and tannic when young, with a dry core. But I also taste red fruits, fresh acidity and a lively, fresh aftertaste. Just be patient."
Domaine Castel Oualou 2016 Fût de Chêne Red (Lirac),Domaine Castel Oualou,Red,Fût de Chêne,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Lirac, Rhône Valley, France",13.5%,$20,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Oak aging lends a savory, earthen quality to fleshy black-cherry and plum flavors in this wine. Medium bodied and restrained in style, the black-fruit flavors are intensely ripe and concentrated but also muted and smoky. Approachable now the wine should hold through 2023."
Château Teynac 2015  Saint-Julien,Château Teynac,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Julien, Bordeaux, France",13%,$39,93,Roger Voss,"This perfumed wine is now approaching maturity.

Manu 2015 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),Manu,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13%,$20,88,Christina Pickard,"A plush, fairly flashy style, this wine starts with ripe, bright red fruit, licorice, raspberry leaf and some savory undertones. The palate bumps the style up a notch, with powerful tannins and plenty of acidity. Perhaps the more intriguing element to this Pinot is the finish: Tart cranberry and floral tones are long and lingering."
Barons 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Barons,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.1%,$45,90,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas explore Cabernet's greener side, with overt notes of bell pepper along with vanilla and other barrel spices.

Bodega Toneles 2012 Tonel 22 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Bodega Toneles,Red,Tonel 22,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$12,87,Michael Schachner,"Ripe plum and berry aromas are supported by a full dose of smoky, savory oak. The palate is round yet jagged, while flavors of toasty, chocolaty berry fruits are also lightly herbal and heavily oaked."
Xanadu 2006 Dragon Chardonnay (Margaret River),Xanadu,White,Dragon,Chardonnay,"Margaret River, Western Australia, Australia",12.5%,$14,85,Joe Czerwinski,"An effusively fruity, unoaked style of Chardonnay, with bold flavors of pear, apple and citrus and maybe even a touch of mango. Its charms are upfront for all to see, as it loses a bit of intensity and lacks length on the finish."
Tagaro 2017 Seicaselle Negroamaro (Salice Salentino),Tagaro,Red,Seicaselle,"Negroamaro, Italian Red","Salice Salentino, Southern Italy, Italy",14%,$14,87,Alexander Peartree,"Brandy soaked plum and plenty of sweet and savory spices grace the nose of this lush red. The palate is soft and supple, yet properly lifted by enough tangy red fruit to balance out the sweet spice flavors."
Pellegrini 2019 Rosé (Russian River Valley),Pellegrini,Rose,,Rosé,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.8%,$30,90,Virginie Boone,"This is made from 90% Pinot Noir and 10% Carignan, the grapes both bled and direct-pressed to make the wine.

There's a touch of cherry Popsicle also. It's an undeniably pretty wine, ready to drink, though don't look for much in the way of either depth or concentration."
Dão Sul 2013 Palestra Branco White (Douro),Dão Sul,White,Palestra Branco,Portuguese White,"Douro, Portugal",12.5%,,84,Roger Voss,"This is a light, soft and creamy wine, with an apricot aroma and flavor, fresh acidity and an attractive fruity aftertaste. It is crisp in green apple and grapefruit notes on the finish."
Cantine Cipressi 2006 Mekan Montepulciano (Molise),Cantine Cipressi,Red,Mekan,"Montepulciano, Italian Red","Molise, Southern Italy, Italy",13.5%,$17,88,,"Montepulciano grapes are aged six months in oak to render sweet nuances of cinnamon and toasted almond that rest over a dense core of jammy fruit. The wine is lush, soft and velvety on the finish."
Companhia das Quintas 2005 Quinta da Pancas Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet Sauvignon (Estremadura),Companhia das Quintas,Red,Quinta da Pancas Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Estremadura, Portugal",14%,$15,85,Roger Voss,"Even Cabernet Sauvignon, that defiantly international variety, takes on a Portuguese character. This has that dark chocolate, high acidity and dry, but juicy character that marks so many Portuguese reds. It also has a more unfortunate volatility that is just too prominent."
Odfjell 2004 Armador Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Odfjell,Red,Armador,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Maipo Valley, Chile",13.5%,$12,87,Michael Schachner,"Here's a nice and dark Cab with black licorice, clove, pepper and blackberry aromas.

Shows the blackberry, cherry, nougat, roasted almond and chocolate flavors of a delicious granola bar. The tannins are a work of art, soft, intricate and refined."
Atwater 2013 North Block Six Cabernet Franc (Seneca Lake),Atwater,Red,North Block Six,Cabernet Franc,"Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York, US",13%,$18,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This wine is a fine showcase of Cabernet Franc's seemingly contradictory juxtaposition of ripe fruit flavors against its herbaceous green elements. Black cherry and berry flavors are succulent and mouthwatering, yet show a savory restraint anchored by swathes of ripe bramble and dusty herbs. It's an elegant yet easing drinking wine marked by fine, penetrating tannins."
Durigutti 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Durigutti,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$16,84,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of green bean and citrus peel struggle to impress. This feels raw and pinching, with pulling, dry tannins. Herbal red-plum flavors finish green and with an oaky note of carob."
Patz & Hall 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),Patz & Hall,White,,Chardonnay,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$40,91,Virginie Boone,"Crafted from a range of vineyards, including Gap's Crown and some new sites in this vintage, this lovely, well-made and balanced wine is made in larger quantities than the producer's vineyard-designates and is enjoyable young.

The wine doesn't have big intensity, but offers clean freshness instead."
Bodewell 2017 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Bodewell,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13%,$20,87,Paul Gregutt,"Pretty strawberry and milk chocolate scents introduce a new wine from a company that says its offerings are based on algorithms. This one, algorithmic or not, is a fairly ordinary bottle of Oregon Pinot, tightly wound and earthy, with some bitter phenolics."
K Vintners 2006 Morrison Lane Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),K Vintners,Red,Morrison Lane,,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$45,91,Paul Gregutt,"Black cherry and berry fruits are front and center, tannins are ripe but carry an herbal edge, and the time in barrels adds a chocolaty underpinning. The finish goes dark, with mocha, espresso, black olive and smoke, and the alcohol rests at a sensible 14.5%."
Cuatro Rayas 2005 Verdejo (Rueda),Cuatro Rayas,White,,"Verdejo, Spanish White","Rueda, Northern Spain, Spain",12.5%,$13,82,Michael Schachner,"Prickly and generic, with flat, cushy citrus flavors that don't hold court for long. Finishes mealy and pithy, with the essence of lemon juice."

Quite heavy on the tongue, with soft acids. Seems a bit gummy and candied, and just not that precise, despite delivering some rich flavors."
Domaine des Bouzons 2018 La Félicité Red (Côtes du Rhône),Domaine des Bouzons,Red,La Félicité,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Côtes du Rhône, Rhône Valley, France",13.5%,$18,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This piquant Syrah-dominant blend is augmented by 20% Grenache. The palate is packed with black cherry and boysenberry flavors edged by sun-scorched garrigue and hits of black pepper and clove.

The broad, round palate is still raw with yeasty notions. but a vein of lemony brightness awaits underneath. With time, the generous, creamy wine will coalesce around it. Drink 2022–2030."

Navarro 2015 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Anderson Valley),Navarro,White,Barrel Fermented,Chardonnay,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14.1%,$27,89,Jim Gordon,"This is a well-balanced medium-bodied wine that has everything in good proportion. The aromas are lightly fruity, like green apples, the tangy apple flavors are touched with of fresh herbs, and the texture is fresh and crisp."

Claiborne & Churchill 2012 Pinot Gris (Central Coast),Claiborne & Churchill,White,,,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",13.8%,$20,89,,"The winery's 2012 dry whites offer plenty of value-driven quality, as usual.

Abeja 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Abeja,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$42,93,Paul Gregutt,"In this warm, ripe, lush and forward vintage, winemaker John Abbott has outdone himself. This is immediately appealing, sending a rush of black cherry and cassis fruit backed with darker notes of coffee, smoke and licorice. The flavors are dense and supple, and the wine combines grace and power, unfolding with additional layers of tar, green tea and smoky herb."
D'Arenberg 2012 The Laughing Magpie Shiraz-Viognier (McLaren Vale),D'Arenberg,Red,The Laughing Magpie,,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",14.2%,$29,87,Christina Pickard,"There's only 7% Viognier in this blend but it shows, lifting the aromas of green veg, orange rind and plum sauce with some welcome floral tones. It's got the d'Arenberg stamp of approachability: appealing tangy fruit and plenty of interesting secondary characters, but it's lacking the label's usual softness and, for the moment anyway, the oak is on the chunky side and the tannins a little chewy."
Cowhorn 2011 Grenache 42 Grenache (Applegate Valley),Cowhorn,Red,Grenache 42,Grenache,"Applegate Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",13.3%,$45,86,Sean P. Sullivan,"From the cool 2011 vintage, this wine brings notes of black tea, dark raspberries and herbs. It's tangy with lip-smacking plum and cranberry flavors backed by firm tannins."

This wine with cherry flavors and acidity has a light structure and great fruitiness. Drink from 2020.
Château Couhins-Lurton 2007  Pessac-Léognan,Château Couhins-Lurton,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,,88,Roger Voss,"A dry, spicy wine, with some good dense tannins. There is some power here, the dark fruits hinting at sweetness, but this is followed by the high acidity typical of the vintage. It should all come together in a year to 18 months."
J. Lohr 2017 Los Osos Merlot (Paso Robles),J. Lohr,Red,Los Osos,Merlot,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14%,VivinoGary's Wine,88,Matt Kettmann,"This is a solid choice for midweek enjoyment. Generous aromas of ripe fresh red fruits meet with crushed slate, gravel and a kiss of sweet oak on the nose. It's lively on the palate, where juicy red cherry and oak framed by a spicy acidity."
Karly 2005 Pokerville Zinfandel (Amador County),Karly,Red,Pokerville,Zinfandel,"Amador County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.4%,$13,88,,"A really great mountain Zinfandel that shows luscious power and fruit at a fair price. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, oranges, cloves and white pepper flood the palate and are just wonderful to experience. At this price, buy this Zin by the case."
Cave de Ribeauvillé 2013 Rodern Pinot Noir (Alsace),Cave de Ribeauvillé,Red,Rodern,Pinot Noir,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$26,86,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Red plum and strawberry compote rise faintly from the glass. The palate is fruity but dilute, easy and clean. Drink soon and possibly chilled a little to accentuate the freshness."
La Jota Vineyard 2018 Merlot (Howell Mountain),La Jota Vineyard,Red,,Merlot,"Howell Mountain, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$85,95,Virginie Boone,"Reductive on the nose, this bold mountain red is brimming in plum, cranberry and currant, with underlying earthiness that complements in savory cedar and tobacco. High-toned acidity and lifted aromatics provide a balance and brightness that surprises and lengthens the impressive palate."
Vinyes dels Aspres 2008 Blanc dels Aspres Garnacha Blanca (Empordà),Vinyes dels Aspres,White,Blanc dels Aspres,"Garnacha Blanca, Spanish White","Empordà, Northern Spain, Spain",14.5%,$28,89,Michael Schachner,"Almondy and smoky on the nose, which is a textbook combo for this variety. The wine was 50% barrel-fermented, but it's not a woody, toasty product. Instead, it's focused and fruity, with a pretty mix of tropical flavors, banana and melon. Decidedly not bitter, with honey and light notes of vanilla on the finish."
Husch 2014 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Husch,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",13.9%,$25,92,Jim Gordon,"Husch is one of the original Anderson Valley wineries and has not been a particular Pinot Noir star, but this fantastic 2014 may start a trend. Fresh and alive, the wine is medium bodied but packs lots of tangy cherry and almost jammy plum flavors into a smooth but lightly tannic texture that provides great structure. Simply delicious, it's balanced well enough to enjoy time after time."
Taltarni 2003 Shiraz (Heathcote),Taltarni,Red,,,"Heathcote, Victoria, Australia",14%,$35,87,,"Smells of raspberries, but tastes meaty, chalky and a hint metallic, though the metallic edge isn't too much of a bother. Thick, dusty, very dry tannins complete the picture. Imported by Clos Du Val Wine."
Barnwood 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),Barnwood,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",,$22,83,,"Smells ripe and fruity, then provides a letdown once it hits the mouth. The promise of currant and cherry turns herbal, with a hint of blackberry. This dry wine finishes with astringent tannins."
Hastwell & Lightfoot 2002 Viognier (McLaren Vale),Hastwell & Lightfoot,White,,Viognier,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",13.5%,$22,86,,"Here's a wine that caused some debate among our editors. It's weighty in the mouth, with flavors that approach a cordial-filled white chocolate candy, finishing with passion fruit and more white chocolate. Your thoughts on the wine will hinge on whether you think it's lush and hedonistic, and practically fit for dessert, or just too heavy and low acid for its own good."
Maipe 2011 Andean Culture Malbec (Mendoza),Maipe,Red,Andean Culture,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$13,87,Michael Schachner,"Opens with berry fruit aromas, density and slightly medicinal notes. Feels bright and lively, with ample acidity pushing toasty, lightly herbal flavors of blackberry and plum. Shows mild spice, licorice and barrel notes on the finish, along with herbal notes. Seems like a very good everyday or value-driven choice."
Jeaunaux-Robin NV Le Talus de Saint Prix Extra Brut  (Champagne),Jeaunaux-Robin,Sparkling,Le Talus de Saint Prix Extra Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$42,92,Roger Voss,"With the high percentage of Pinot Meunier typical of the producer, this Champagne is already ripe and smooth.

Lightly pickled lime and tangerine flavors finish dry, slightly bitter and briny, with a coarse but crisp feel of seltzer."
Binyamina 2009 The Chosen Diamond Red (Galilee),Binyamina,Red,The Chosen Diamond,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Galilee, Israel",14%,$60,88,Lauren Buzzeo,"Scents of mixed forest berries, red plum, fresh thyme and bay laurel lead the bouquet of this wine, and carry though to the juicy palate. Approachable and enjoyable now, with ripe fruit flavors and a hint of chocolate that stays through the medium-length finish. 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Syrah and 10% Petit Verdot. Mevushal."
Foxen 7200 2017 Vogelzang Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),Foxen 7200,Red,Vogelzang Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California, US",14%,$58,92,Matt Kettmann,"Dark-blackberry aromas meet with crushed rock, turned soil, espresso bean and a light minty tone on the nose of this bottling. The palate snaps with fresh blackberry, orange-peel, black-pepper and wild sage flavors, framed in a firm structure."
Chateau Ste. Michelle 2016 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),Chateau Ste. Michelle,White,,,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,DrizlyVivino,88,Sean P.

Château de Parenchère 2015  Bordeaux Blanc,Château de Parenchère,White,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Bordeaux Blanc, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$13,87,Roger Voss,"On the eastern end of the Bordeaux appellation, this Gazaniol property reserves 10 of 161 acres for its white blend. This is a ripe, soft wine that is rounded with peach and red-apple fruit flavors. Crisp acidity gives it some tightness to balance the full, fruity character of the wine. Drink now."
Chacewater 2016 Windrem Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),Chacewater,White,Windrem Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,"Lake County, Lake County, California, US",13.8%,$18,89,Jim Gordon,"This is a nicely dry, fresh and restrained wine. Its best attributes are lightly fruity aromas, white-pepper and wet-stone flavors and a tangy mouthfeel, with a good snap of astringency."
Argyle 2002 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Argyle,Red,Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$30,87,,"Good concentration and noticeable density, with intriguing, briary flavors that mix candied fruit with dusty herbs, cinnamon and cocoa."
Gamache 2006 Estate Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Gamache,Red,Estate,Merlot,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$24,86,Paul Gregutt,"This feels a bit stripped, though the bottle says the alcohol hits almost 15%. There is a chocolaty coating over sharp, herbal, rather thin fruit flavors. The wine shows pleasant strawberry and watermelon fruit flavors, though the tannins and chocolaty barrel flavors quickly take over."
Boeger 2016 Pinot Grande White Pinot Noir (El Dorado),Boeger,White,Pinot Grande White,Pinot Noir,"El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",13.1%,$28,87,Jim Gordon,"Made as a white wine from dark Pinot Noir grapes, this medium-bodied wine has earthy aromas and savory herbal flavors that give it a rustic character.

The wine is surpassingly soft, as if the tannins had miraculously, spellbindingly vanished. The fruit tastes of berries and plums, with some coffee mocha streaks in the finish."
Domaine de la Gaverie 2014 Demi-Sec  (Vouvray),Domaine de la Gaverie,White,Demi-Sec,Chenin Blanc,"Vouvray, Loire Valley, France",12%,$15,90,Roger Voss,"Lightly off dry, this rich, smooth wine has acidity to balance the honey and ripe pineapple flavors. With some aging, it will show a delicious, ripe balance of fruit and creamy texture, with some zest to add liveliness. Drink from 2017."
Christian Moueix 2005 Merlot  (Bordeaux),Christian Moueix,Red,Merlot,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",13%,$11,84,Roger Voss,"A young, very fruity wine produced by Christian Moueix. It is structured, firm and juicy, layered with dry tannins, probably needing 6–12 months of aging. A touch of pepper, red currants, toast and acidity complete this good, very Bordeaux, wine."

Iijima,"Initial notes of smoke and mineral open into blossom and raspberry in this wine. Dry and medium bodied in style, it is a refreshingly straightforward summer sip with easy white-peach and red-cherry flavors. The finish is brisk but accented by a touch of caramel. Drink now."

On the palate, vanilla, licorice, dark chocolate and espresso accent the black cherry core while polished tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2017."
Marquee 2005 Classic Chardonnay (Victoria),Marquee,White,Classic,Chardonnay,"Victoria, Victoria, Australia",13.9%,$10,82,Joe Czerwinski,"Starts off with promising tropical fruit overtones, but loses steam on the palate, where the fruit is slightly stewed, some of the wine's alcohol shows through and a trace of bitterness emerges."
Georg Breuer 1998 Rauenthal Nonnenberg Riesling (Rheingau),Georg Breuer,White,Rauenthal Nonnenberg,Riesling,"Rheingau, Germany",12%,$36,89,,"Solid and well-rounded, this very tasty wine has lively spice and apple aromas. The juice has nice texture on the tongue, well defined apple and peach flavors, and again the spice, which may be characteristic of the Nonnenberg vineyard. The long, even finish shows the tangy spice elements well. Will drink well for the next five years, maybe more."
Château d'Ollières 2016 Prestige Red (Coteaux Varois en Provence),Château d'Ollières,Red,Prestige,,"Coteaux Varois en Provence, Provence, France",13.5%,$29,91,Roger Voss,"This is a richly ripe blend of Grenache and Syrah.

Joleté 2012 Pinot Noir (Oregon),Joleté,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",13.9%,$22,88,Paul Gregutt,"Ready for immediate enjoyment, this offers a lifted nose of rose petals and cherry blossoms, carrying a slight whiff of milk chocolate. The fruit has a tart, cranberry character, moving up into Bing cherry flavors with plenty of crisp acidity."
Pindar Vineyards 1999 Ice Wine Johannisberg Riesling (Long Island),Pindar Vineyards,Dessert,Ice Wine,"Johannisberg Riesling, Riesling","Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",,$35,90,Joe Czerwinski,"Sure, it's made “artificially” in a commercial freezer, but so what? It tastes good. Dried apricots and honey are imbued with layers of flavor and richness. Enough acidity to avoid being cloying, but not so much that you'll want to age it. Drink now."
Château de Fuissé 2007 Vieilles Vignes  (Pouilly-Fuissé),Château de Fuissé,White,Vieilles Vignes,Chardonnay,"Pouilly-Fuissé, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$57,93,Roger Voss,"“Old vines” here means more than 20 years. But the wine owes its concentration to the selection of parcels and fruit as much as the vines' age. For there certainly is a rich intensity in this impressive, rounded wine. The spice and pear flavors are lifted by sweet green fruits and white berries. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd."
Les Dauphins 2018 Réserve Rosé (Côtes du Rhône),Les Dauphins,Rose,Réserve,Rosé,"Côtes du Rhône, Rhône Valley, France",12.5%,$12,89,Anna Lee C.

This Monastrell feels choppy and broken. Saucy berry flavors are loaded with oak and clove notes, while this wine tastes like chocolate and feels hot on the finish."
Agrisole 2013 Malvasia Nera (Toscana),Agrisole,Red,,"Malvasia Nera, Italian Red","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$35,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made entirely with Malvasia Nera, this opens with aromas of black cherry, ground pepper and cocoa that carry over to the straightforward palate.

Michel Torino 2007 Cuma Organic Cabernet Sauvignon (Cafayate),Michel Torino,Red,Cuma Organic,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Cafayate, Other, Argentina",13.5%,$13,84,Michael Schachner,"Bubble gum on the nose makes you wonder about carbonic maceration, but that technique wasn't used to make this fruity, simple and generally nice little Cabernet. Don't expect complexity from it, or much varietal character; this is your basic red wine with adequate sweetness and some chocolate."
J. Portugal Ramos 2012 Loios Branco White (Alentejano),J. Portugal Ramos,White,Loios Branco,Portuguese White,"Alentejano, Portugal",12.5%,$10,85,Roger Voss,"This is a light and fruity wine from J.

Edio 2018 Chene Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),Edio,Red,Chene Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14%,$60,93,Matt Kettmann,"Dried rose petals, a flash of violet and dried red-currant aromas show on the nose of this single-vineyard expression from a special and small site. The palate is dry in texture, offering rose petals and pomegranate flavors in a subtle and elegant display."
Feudi del Pisciotto 2008 Missoni Cabernet Sauvignon (Sicilia),Feudi del Pisciotto,Red,Missoni,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13.5%,,87,,"Here's an inky black and densely concentrated Cabernet Sauvignon that would pair with grilled sausage or barbecued steak. The wine is soft, round and slightly sweet on the finish."
Prospice 2017 Phinny Hill Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Horse Heaven Hills),Prospice,Red,Phinny Hill Vineyard,Cabernet Franc,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$50,93,Sean P. Sullivan,"We know what a special vineyard this is for Cabernet Sauvignon, but this wine shows that the grape's progenitor can excel there, too. Its 100% varietal, alluring aromas of raspberry, earth, herbs and flowers focus the attention. The palate is dense and textured, full of dark-fruit flavors with a firm sense of tannic structure. The balance is impressive. Best after 2024."
Montes 2007 Classic Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),Montes,Red,Classic Series,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",14.5%,$12,86,Michael Schachner,"Good but common as Chilean Cabs go. It's a jumbled mass of bulky fruit, raw power, sweet oak and spice. The mouthfeel is tannic, grabby and big, while the flavors of black cherry and raspberry are nice but generic. Finishes with spice and a hint of hickory. 20,000 cases produced."
Tuerce Botas 2016  Rioja,Tuerce Botas,Red,,"Garnacha, Grenache","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$22,86,Michael Schachner,"Reduction on the nose creates aromas of tire rubber and black olive. On the palate, this is thick and rather sticky. Chocolaty oak dominates the palate, which also includes minty berry flavors and green notes."
JM Cellars 2009 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),JM Cellars,Red,Boushey Vineyard,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.9%,$45,93,Paul Gregutt,"An elegant showcase for the Boushey fruit, this new JM Cellars release displays refined raspberry fruit, coated in silky cocoa and almond butter. Firmly acidic, sleek and racy, it gains complexity and texture through a lingering, tobacco-laden finish."
Bokisch 2004 Garnacha (Lodi),Bokisch,Red,,"Garnacha, Grenache","Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",,$18,85,,"Soft and melted in tannins and acids, this dry red wine, which is the same as Grenache, has intense flavors of perfectly ripened cherries, with a rich coat of oak. There's a peppery tingly feeling that suggests a nice barbecued steak."
Massolino 2007 Parussi  (Barolo),Massolino,Red,Parussi,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$95,91,,"Massolino delivers a beautifully compact and elegant Nebbiolo with soft layers of spice and red fruit enhanced by bright intensity, menthol layers, licorice and cherry cola.

It's a refreshing wine that is ready now."
Château Haut Caillou 2018  Lalande de Pomerol,Château Haut Caillou,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Lalande de Pomerol, Bordeaux, France",13%,$30,91,Roger Voss,"The estate emphasizes the environmental balance of its vineyards. This dense wine is dominated by 80% Merlot. The wood aging shows but will integrate as the black-plum fruits develop, resulting in a balanced, ageworthy wine. Drink from 2022."
Bodegas Ontañón 2011 Crianza  (Rioja),Bodegas Ontañón,Red,Crianza,,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$15,89,Michael Schachner,"Gritty, muscular aromas of charred, smoky black fruits and asphalt give way to a medium-full palate with good acidity. Saucy, savory berry and plum flavors finish with notes of herbs and tobacco. For Rioja crianza, this is more than satisfying."
Tarara 2008 Chardonnay (Virginia),Tarara,White,,Chardonnay,"Virginia, Virginia, US",14%,$25,84,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Here's a find for lovers of big, buttery wine. Dripping with cream and butter, Tarara's darkly toasted, full-bodied Chardonnay screams new French oak.

Martin Ray 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Martin Ray,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14%,$40,84,,"There's something subtlely unripe about this Pinot Noir.

Coeur d'Alene 2004 Opulence Syrah (Washington),Coeur d'Alene,Red,Opulence,,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$40,91,Paul Gregutt,"An excellent Syrah. It's opulent almost to a fault, the fruit thick as a brick and ripe to the point of raisiny. It's buoyed with firm acidity and loads of black pepper and pencil lead. The wine is still a bit of a monster at 15.5% alcohol, but it's a loveable monster for sure."
Château Bahans Haut-Brion 2005  Pessac-Léognan,Château Bahans Haut-Brion,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,$75,92,Roger Voss,"The second wine of Château Haut-Brion is firm, mirroring its grand vin.

Details of fresh ground herbs come up also, and the melding of fruit, acid and tannin suggests medium-term aging potential. Drink now–2026."
François Lurton 2008 Piedra Negra Malbec (Mendoza),François Lurton,Red,Piedra Negra,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.5%,$40,88,Michael Schachner,"Lemon peel, wet clay, sandalwood and nutmeg aromas are inviting.

Aresti 2005 Reserve Carmenère (Rio Claro),Aresti,Red,Reserve,Carmenère,"Rio Claro, Chile",13.5%,$14,83,Michael Schachner,"Tomato leaf, raspberry and earth aromas lead into a sharp, acidic palate that turns the cherry and raspberry flavors toward jagged and pointy. The finish is mildly lemony and on the sharp side, with a hint of carob flavor. Registers as green and lean."

Treat this as a good food wine, rather than as an apéritif."
Pflüger 2017 Quarzit Trocken Chardonnay (Pfalz),Pflüger,White,Quarzit Trocken,Chardonnay,"Pfalz, Germany",12.5%,$24,90,Anna Lee C.

Iijima,"Smoky notes of graphite and incense accent crisp blackberry and plum in this light-footed, spice-inflected Lemberger. It's a brisk, fresh, concentrated red backed by pert red currant acidity and very fine, feathery tannins. Ready now but should drink at peak through 2027."
Winzer Krems 2018 Sandgrube 13 Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),Winzer Krems,White,Sandgrube 13,Grüner Veltliner,"Niederösterreich, Austria",12.5%,$14,88,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Pear drop candy freshness on the nose suggests ease and lightness.

Ripe and with just a hint of honey, it is full and rich, almost too dense. There is enough acidity to keep the wine's freshness in place and it could certainly age for a few more months. Drink from 2021."
André Kientzler 2013 Cuvée MIllésimée Non Dosée Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),André Kientzler,Sparkling,Cuvée MIllésimée Non Dosée,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Crémant d'Alsace, Alsace, France",12%,$26,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Brisk lemon freshness sets the tone on the nose.

Geyser Peak 2004 Merlot (Alexander Valley),Geyser Peak,Red,,Merlot,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$19,87,,"This isn't a very complex Merlot, but it is textbook if you're looking for soft fruitiness. It has oak-influenced cherry and blackberry flavors, with hints of violets and fruit tea, and is dry and dusty in tannins. Give it more concentration and it would be a star."
Château Franc Lartigue 2016  Saint-Émilion,Château Franc Lartigue,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",14%,$53,92,Roger Voss,"Vines with an average age of 35 years have produced a concentrated wine.

Acidity stars, giving zesty balance to the ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and pear flavors. New oak, to the tune of 40%, adds an opulent touch."
Rex Hill 2018 Seven Soils Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Rex Hill,White,Seven Soils,Chardonnay,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$35,88,Paul Gregutt,"This enters with a soft, slightly soapy mouthfeel, showing quince and gooseberry fruit as it tightens up in the mouth. There's a streak of celery, green apple and a hint of toasted hazelnut. At least at this stage of life it's a bit disjointed, so aggressive aeration is recommended."

The cherry flavors taste like they were dusted with white sugar."
Napa Ridge 2003 Merlot (Napa Valley),Napa Ridge,Red,,Merlot,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$12,83,,"Despite the smooth tannins, delicious blackberry and cherry fruit and good acidity, this wine finishes just a little too sweet for comfort, although some wine aficienadoes will enjoy that burst of sugar."
Adelaida 2011 Anna's Estate Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles),Adelaida,Red,Anna's Estate Vineyard,,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15.5%,$32,86,,"This 100% Syrah is rich and ripe in blackberry jam and new oak flavors. It's dry, with a fruity sweetness, and the tannins are strong but yielding. High alcohol gives it a hot feeling. Barbecue is your best bet."
Shannon Ridge 2005 Syrah (High Valley),Shannon Ridge,Red,,,"High Valley, Lake County, California, US",14.4%,$19,88,,"Shows its aspirations to the northern Rhône in the 100% varietal that's wrapped in dense young tannins now, but deep down below brims with finely ripe fruit. Black currants, licorice, mu shu pork plum sauce, sweet worn leather and Asian spice flavors mingle into a long, complex finish. This is a wine to watch."

Loberger 2015 Sélection de Grains Nobles Riesling (Alsace),Loberger,Dessert,Sélection de Grains Nobles,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13.5%,,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Apricot compote and lifted citrus make for a heady, almost ethereal opening on the nose of this wine. Hints of mint tisane and blossom honey come into play with more air. The palate is richly and decadently sweet, but this is countered by the Riesling's focused acidity, lending drama and drive. The concentrated palate finishes with whistle-clean, mouthwatering richness."
Torres 2005 Mas La Plana Cabernet Sauvignon (Penedès),Torres,Red,Mas La Plana,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Penedès, Catalonia, Spain",14%,$63,88,Michael Schachner,"Heavily roasted and loaded up with coffee, mocha and other huge oak-based aromas. Frankly, there's so much new-barrel influence on this youngster that it's hard to assess. Once you're past the oak, there's deep fruit in the blackberry and cassis realm, and then fierce tannins that dry out the palate. Needs time."
Vignamaggio 2016 Santa Maria Merlot (Toscana),Vignamaggio,Red,Santa Maria,Merlot,"Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$55,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"This Merlot has aromas of tilled soil, toasted oak and mocha.

Talus 2000 Shiraz (California),Talus,Red,,,"California, California Other, California, US",,$9,83,,"What you see is what you get, an inexpensive wine from the Delta. It's dark, dry and jammy, and as cleanly made as American winemaking allows. Hamburgers or, better still, cheeseburgers come to  mind."

Right now, it's young, eking out notes of apple skins, blossoms, grapefruit and talc. The balance is spot on, and while this would be delicious now with shellfish, it'd be even better with some time in the cellar. Drink now–2032."

Piña 2001 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),Piña,Red,Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Howell Mountain, Napa, California, US",,$54,94,,"This is a wine that will change your perception of Howell Mountain Cabs as wines that you have to cellar to enjoy. Yes, it's tannic enough for the long haul, but so good now, it's hard not to drink it. Packed with ripe, rich currant, cherry and sweet tobacco fruit, with vanilla and cocoa seasonings, it's absolutely delicious. Drink now through 2012."
Foundry 2013 Lindsay's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Foundry,Red,Lindsay's Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",13.7%,$48,88,Matt Kettmann,"Dense but not overpowering aromas of iron, cherry jelly, dried cranberries and black rocks show on this wine, a combo of the Pommard and 2A clones. It's fairly lush at the tip of the sip, with smoked-meat flavors, but then stays reserved down the middle, with pencil lead, cranberry fruit and sanguine notes into the finish."
Jean-Luc Baldès 2011 Clos Triguedina  (Cahors),Jean-Luc Baldès,Red,Clos Triguedina,Malbec,"Cahors, Southwest France, France",13%,$40,91,Roger Voss,"The estate wine of Jean-Luc Baldès is often overshadowed by the limited production wines. In itself, though, it is a firm, solid, well balanced wine, rich and expressing the minerality of Malbec in Cahors. This vintage should be aged, drink from 2016."

Château des Perligues 2010  Graves,Château des Perligues,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Graves, Bordeaux, France",12.5%,$13,87,Roger Voss,"Structured and aromatic, this is an immediately attractive wine. It has a ripe, juicy character, balanced by firm, dry tannins. At this stage, although drinkable, it will certainly benefit from 3–4 years of aging."
Skinner 2015 Viognier (El Dorado),Skinner,White,,Viognier,"El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.1%,$24,89,Jim Gordon,"This wine's prominent buttery aromas grab one's attention right away, and that same buttery element runs through the flavors and lingers on the finish.

It needs a bit of swirling in glass or decanter to come together but when it does it reveals notes of soy sauce, stalks, raspberries and roasted beets on both the nose and the palate. The mouthfeel is granular, smudged by spicy tannins and a lick of toasty oak—a powerful but charming wine for drinking in the short term."

The mouthfeel is rich and textured and because the tannins still need to soften, we recommend you put this bottle down in your cellar for a few more years."
Rochioli 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),Rochioli,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$35,84,,"Rochioli's Sauvignon Blanc declined in quality in the 2006 vintage, and 2007 continues that downward trend. It may be the chilly vintage, but this release is thin and minty, with green, gooseberry flavors that barely manage to veer into citrus fruits."
Jurtschitsch 2016 Ried Käferberg Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),Jurtschitsch,White,Ried Käferberg,Grüner Veltliner,"Kamptal, Austria",13%,$42,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Fragrant green notes inform the nose of this wine: there are moss and sage, citrus foliage and fern scents. That herbal richness also plays on the slender, fresh and streamlined palate. Citrus freshness emanates from the textured flavors, softened slightly by salty yeast notes. An impressive, concentrated wine with lots of potential. Drink 2018–2028."
Château de Cérons 2018  Graves,Château de Cérons,White,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Graves, Bordeaux, France",12%,$35,87,Roger Voss,"Crisp and fruity, this wine is fresh and flavorful. Its acidity and bright texture are attractive and accessible. The finish with hints of juicy white currants continues the theme. Drink the wine now."
Zenaida Cellars 2015 Wanderlust Red (Templeton Gap District),Zenaida Cellars,Red,Wanderlust,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Templeton Gap District, Central Coast, California, US",15.2%,$42,91,Matt Kettmann,"Tangy plum skins and mulberry sauce meet with salt and pepper and roasted duck aromas on the nose of this blend of 50% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre. The palate is full of brambly fruit, lifted by smoke and sagebrush."
Great White Wines 2004 Chardonnay (Western Cape),Great White Wines,White,,Chardonnay,"Western Cape, South Africa",13.5%,$9,83,,"Another wine from the label with the smiling shark I've come to call Jovial Jaws. Simple, generic Chardonnay, with a bit-too-sweet-perfumy profile, though the palate is actually drier than the nose or close. This can pass muster at a large party or gallery opening."
Carmen 2017 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),Carmen,Red,Gran Reserva,Carmenère,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",14%,$19,87,Michael Schachner,"Jammy berry aromas are ripe and slightly candied, with only a hint of Carmenère's patented green. A full, round palate ranks as dense, while this tastes of ripe black fruits and toast prior to a peppery finish where dry tannins take over."
Maryhill 2016 Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Maryhill,Red,Proprietor's Reserve,Cabernet Franc,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.8%,$38,85,Sean P. Sullivan,"With almost all of the fruit coming from Tudor Hills Vineyard, this is 100% varietal, though the variety seems hard to find. The aromas bring unusual, somewhat off-putting notes of soil, espresso bean, dried orange rind and cherry. The coffee flavors start out full and then taper toward the finish."
Château Cheval Blanc 2013 Le Petit Cheval Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),Château Cheval Blanc,Red,Le Petit Cheval Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,91,Roger Voss,"90–92. Barrel Sample. This is a serious, dark wine, with ripe and concentrated Merlot-based character. It has ample density, although there is a light touch that brings out black currant fruitiness as well as bright acidity."
Herdade da Comporta 2009 Branco White (Península de Setúbal),Herdade da Comporta,White,Branco,Portuguese White,"Península de Setúbal, Portugal",13.5%,$16,84,Roger Voss,"Ripe pear fruit flavors go with green plums in the wine that has acidity, but does seem just too hot and heavy."
Colosi 2015 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),Colosi,Red,,"Nero d'Avola, Italian Red","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13.5%,$13,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with tilled soil, Mediterranean brush and black-skinned berry aromas. The round palate offers black cherry, raspberry jam and a white pepper note alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon."
Bründlmayer NV Brut Reserve Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt),Bründlmayer,Sparkling,Brut Reserve,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Österreichischer Sekt, Austria",11.5%,$50,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Baked apple and the mellow ripeness of Golden Pearmain apple perfume the nose. The palate adds the creaminess of very fine fizz and the vivid freshness of lemon to this slender, elegant and very expressive Sekt. The finish is totally clean, brisk and utterly moreish. Just made for a classy apero."
Brovia 2006 Ca' Mia  (Barolo),Brovia,Red,Ca' Mia,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",,,90,,"This is a distinctive and unique Barolo with an edgy, brambly quality that comes forth aromatically as wild berry, forest floor, chopped herb, furniture wax for antiques and root beer. The wine leaves your palate with a dry, dusty impression thanks to the fine nature of its tannins."
MacRostie 2018 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Green Valley),MacRostie,White,Charles Heintz Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Green Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14%,$46,94,Virginie Boone,"From the great coastal site, this white sings in fruitful intensity and complex layers of flavor, a burst of Meyer lemon and grapefruit crispness complemented by richer undertones of Meyer lemon meringue and toasted pineapple."
Tasca d'Almerita 2009 Tascante Nerello Mascalese (Sicilia),Tasca d'Almerita,Red,Tascante,"Nerello Mascalese, Italian Red","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13.5%,$40,90,,"Tascante combines “Tasca” and “Etna” spelled backwards. This wine represents the estate's first vintage of Nerello Mascalese from the fiery Sicilian volcano. It's a tight, tonic expression with small berry fruit and a long finish highlighted by crushed clove and nutmeg."
Armanino Family Cellars 2007 The Ringneck La Encantada Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Armanino Family Cellars,Red,The Ringneck La Encantada,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",13.9%,$49,88,,"Marked by acidity and grapeskin bitterness, this is a Pinot Noir to stash in the cellar, in order to let everything resolve. It shows fresh, vibrant flavors of cherries, raspberries and red currants, and is very dry. Should hit its window of opportunity between 2010–2012."
Domaine Schoffit 2013 Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Riesling (Alsace),Domaine Schoffit,White,Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$53,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,"This wine clearly needs to breathe. It is only after a few minutes of airtime that it shows its true colors: then very tart and aromatic apples appear, alongside a hint of smoke and a sheer touch of lemon freshness. The palate continues on that lemony streak and is absolutely dry. The body is lithe and slender and shows great freshness and intensity. Apple and stone flavors linger. Drink 2020–2030."
Producta Vignobles 2012  Bordeaux Supérieur,Producta Vignobles,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux Supérieur, Bordeaux, France",13%,$10,87,Roger Voss,"The wine is closed up and tough. That's no bad thing because the fruit weight is all there. The tannins are dense at the moment, showing signs of hard extraction, not enough to take away from the potential. Drink from 2017."
Scott Paul 2012 La Paulée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Scott Paul,Red,La Paulée,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$39,91,Paul Gregutt,"Pretty scents of rosewater, raspberries and cherries introduce this light and pleasing wine. It carries some of the charm of a good strawberry soda, with forward fruit and a delicate frame. That said, it is not just a simple fruity wine, and gains weight and complexity as it breathes. Give it time to show you all it has."
Patland 2012 Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),Patland,Red,Stagecoach Vineyard,,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.8%,$75,90,Virginie Boone,"A dense, leathery, richly stylized wine from a great vineyard site, this offers thick layers of dark chocolate, blueberry and plum. Integrated in terms of oak and tannin, it delivers concentration and power, capped off on the finish in a shot of cigar."
P.J. Valckenberg 2016 Pinot Blanc (Rheinhessen),P.J. Valckenberg,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Rheinhessen, Germany",13%,$15,86,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A hint of smoked nuts lends a savory tone to flavors of pressed apple and pear. While delicate in concentration, it's dry and approachable, with refreshing lemon-lime acidity. Drink now."
Château Lanscade 2017  Bordeaux,Château Lanscade,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",13%,$14,85,Roger Voss,"Hints of overripe fruits spoil this otherwise attractive, red-berry-flavored wine. Tannins have already softened and blended with the fruits. It should be ready in 2020."
Lake Sonoma 2002 Saini Farms Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),Lake Sonoma,Red,Saini Farms Old Vine,Zinfandel,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",16%,$20,84,,"A tannic wine, and although it's dry, it has overripe, raisiny flavors. Finishes with a rustic roughness and Porty caramel."
Glen Ellen 2008 Proprietor's Reserve Merlot (California),Glen Ellen,Red,Proprietor's Reserve,Merlot,"California, California Other, California, US",13%,VivinoGary's Wine,83,,"On the thin side, and the blackberry and cherry flavors are compromised by some green, minty tannins. But it's not a bad wine for a big party."
Robert Ramsay 2014 McKinley Springs Vineyard Cinsault (Horse Heaven Hills),Robert Ramsay,Red,McKinley Springs Vineyard,"Cinsault, Other Red","Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",15.4%,$32,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"This is a rare 100% varietal, single vineyard example of this grape. Light in color, it brings aromas of gun smoke, herb and cherry, showing some reduction. The flavors are light and elegant, displaying a lot of delicacy."
Delas Frères 2015 Les Launes  (Crozes-Hermitage),Delas Frères,Red,Les Launes,,"Crozes-Hermitage, Rhône Valley, France",13.5%,$22,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whispers of smoke, bacon and violet lend complexity to ripe black plum and mulberry on this inviting Syrah. Its perfume and lavishly concentrated palate offer a bit more intensity than typically seen in Crozes-Hermitage. This briskly balanced, elegant wine with firm tannins is approachable now but should drink well through 2030."
Concrete 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),Concrete,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",15%,$20,89,Jim Gordon,"This big bold wine takes flavor to the limits. Spicy, peppery, beefy aromas and bold smoke, blueberry and clove flavors rely a lot on oak, but have a good concentrated fruit foundation underneath. It is full bodied, mouth-filling and nicely tannic."
Château Recougne 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,Château Recougne,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux Supérieur, Bordeaux, France",13%,$15,88,Roger Voss,The wine has all the potential of ripe fruit and firm tannins. It should become a rich wine with blackberry flavors and a tannic structure. Drink this wine from 2018.
Kana 2005 Cuvée Le Blanc Reserve White (Yakima Valley),Kana,White,Cuvée Le Blanc Reserve,Rhône-style White Blend,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$18,84,Paul Gregutt,"This “Rhône-style white blend” (53% Viognier/37% Roussanne/10% Marsanne) is heavy, hot (14.8%) and dry. The fruit seems attenuated and the flavors thick and simple. Peaches and apricots rule the fruit, with a plastic edge to the finish."
Col d'Orcia 2015  Brunello di Montalcino,Col d'Orcia,Red,,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,VivinoWine Express,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Warm and structured, this has aromas evoking scorched earth, underbrush and mature black-skinned berry. On the firm palate, assertive, close-grained tannins accompany dried black cherry, licorice, sage and tobacco while the warmth of alcohol caps off the finish. Drink 2023–2030."
Juvé y Camps 2008 Brut Nature Gran Reserva Reserva de la Familia Sparkling (Cava),Juvé y Camps,Sparkling,Brut Nature Gran Reserva Reserva de la Familia,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Cava, Catalonia, Spain",12%,$17,83,Michael Schachner,"Normally I'm a fan of Juvé y Camps. This bottling is bland on the nose, with a cleaning-solution aroma. The palate is foamy in feel and short in flavor, with a strange blend of bitter lettuce, brine and green herbs. Frankly, it's not up to par, a possible reflection of the below-average 2008 vintage."
Keermont 2009 Red (Stellenbosch),Keermont,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Stellenbosch, South Africa",14.5%,$40,90,Lauren Buzzeo,"Earthy aromas of forest floor, tobacco leaf and leather mingle harmoniously with the black-fruit core of this Merlot-based blend, with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Syrah and 7% Petit Verdot. The medium-weight palate boasts fruit-skin flavors of plum, cassis and berry, while accents of tobacco, balsamic herbs and pepper unfold on thelingering finish. Drink now–2016."
Elk Cove 2007 Riesling (Willamette Valley),Elk Cove,White,,Riesling,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$19,87,Paul Gregutt,"Quite full of sour candy flavors, with melon and lime accents, this tangy, fruity take on Riesling is not your usual delicate flower. It's big and tart, ready for food."
Ramón Bilbao 2012 Valiñas Albariño (Rías Baixas),Ramón Bilbao,White,Valiñas,Albariño,"Rías Baixas, Galicia, Spain",12.5%,$15,85,Michael Schachner,"White-fruit aromas, brine and clam shell notes get this Albariño going. The mouthfeel is full and lemony. Flavors of pickled, briny citrus and nectarine carry onto the finish. This is at its best now; in 2014 it will not be so good."
Heart & Hands 2017 Seneca East Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),Heart & Hands,White,Seneca East Vineyard,Riesling,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",11.6%,$28,87,Alexander Peartree,"A reticent nose gives way to a light-bodied palate of apple, peach and slightly tropical fruit flavors. Integrated acidity gives a delicate frame to this wine, with a mild concentration of fruit flavors."
Riverbench 2009 Mesa Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),Riverbench,Red,Mesa,Pinot Noir,"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$48,92,,"The Mesa bottling has been a particular success for Riverbench in past vintages, and continues to be today. It's made from a special block in the estate vineyard, and always is unusually concentrated in red fruits, licorice and crushed baking spices, generously coated in sweet oak. It's a beautiful, silky wine of great charm and finesse. Drink now–2015."
La Luciole 2020 Rosé (Vin de France),La Luciole,Rose,,Rosé,"Vin de France, France Other, France",12.5%,$12,86,Fiona Adams,"Pale ballet-slipper pink in the glass, this wine offers aromas of yellow watermelon, fresh strawberry and Rainier cherry. The palate opens with juicy cherry but turns tart with green apple, lime and grapefruit. Some grassiness steps in on the mouthpuckering finish, with tart citrus lingering endlessly."
Mas Pere NV Selecció Brut Sparkling (Cava),Mas Pere,Sparkling,Selecció Brut,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Cava, Catalonia, Spain",11.5%,$13,85,Michael Schachner,"Stalky haystack aromas settle on generic white-fruit scents accented by garlic and mushroom. Despite high acidity, this is notably flat and devoid of bubbles. Honeyed stone fruit flavors finish with a hint of lemon-lime but little more."
Muddy Water 1999 Pinot Noir (Waipara),Muddy Water,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Waipara, New Zealand",13.5%,$25,87,Joe Czerwinski,"Toasty, but backed up by solid black-cherry fruit that fills the mouth with a touch of creaminess. The dark fruit flavors persist well into the finish where they are joined by a hint of mint and smoke."
Gallo Family Vineyards 2005 Sonoma Reserve Syrah (Sonoma County),Gallo Family Vineyards,Red,Sonoma Reserve,,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",14.6%,$15,86,,"Gallo's done a fine job at producing this dry, tannic Syrah at an everyday price. It's a little soft, but quite rich in grilled blackberry, cherry, tangerine, licorice and spicy mocha flavors."
Prunotto 2006 Bric Turot  (Barbaresco),Prunotto,Red,Bric Turot,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",13.5%,$75,91,,"Bric Turot is a rich and powerful Barbaresco that shows excellent integrity and intensity of its fruit flavors. Those tones of red cherry and cassis are backed by layers of spice, leather and dried tobacco leaf."
Boekenhoutskloof 2010 The Wolftrap Rosé (Western Cape),Boekenhoutskloof,Rose,The Wolftrap,Rosé,"Western Cape, South Africa",13.5%,$11,84,Lauren Buzzeo,"Soft peach and wild berries lead the way on the nose, while the medium weight mouth offers a bit more fleshy stone fruit and watermelon flavors. The finish is dry and accented by hints of peppery spice."
Prelius 2018  Maremma Toscana,Prelius,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Maremma Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$18,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made with organically grown grapes, this Cabernet Sauvignon opens with inviting aromas of cassis, underbrush and mint. The savory, polished palate features black currant, licorice and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2026."
Cayuse 2003 Armada Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Cayuse,Red,Armada,,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$65,97,Paul Gregutt,"A truly stunning wine of amazing complexity. It has layers of depth rarely found in any Washington wines, beginning with dense black fruits, black licorice, smoke, pepper and charcoal. The trademark Cayuse herbal/green tea elements are there also, more as hints than as layers. The aging in big neutral barriques has buffed it out; as it breathes in the glass the wine opens beautifully, gaining flesh and density. A genuine tour de force, deeply aromatic and fascinating."
Roessler 2006 Griffin's Lair Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Roessler,Red,Griffin's Lair,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$45,84,,"Raw in acidity, this low-production Pinot offers cherry, red currant, cola and dusty spice flavors. Doesn't seem like it has a future, so drink up."
Monticello Vineyards 2012 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District),Monticello Vineyards,White,Estate Grown,Chardonnay,"Oak Knoll District, Napa, California, US",14.1%,Gary's WineVivino,87,,"Dry, acidic, oaky, it'also a little herbaceous. Orange and mango flavors are enhanced with plenty of oak. While it's elegant, it's not especially rich."
Treasure 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),Treasure,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"St. Helena, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$85,86,Virginie Boone,"This wine has a distinctly strong element of cured meat and salami on the nose, before it lunges wholeheartedly into chocolate, cedar and tobacco tones. Soft significant tannins wrap around the flavors in an impenetrable way."
Comartin 2012 The Porterhouse Syrah-Grenache (Central Coast),Comartin,Red,The Porterhouse,"Syrah-Grenache, Rhône-style Red Blend","Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",14.6%,$40,86,Matt Kettmann,"This blend of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache offers heady and thick violet and plum extract aromas, and smells heavier in alcohol than it is. The palate shows ripe black cherry, but it's eye-wateringly tannic, and needs quite a bit of time in the cellar to evolve."
Glen Fiona 2006 Puncheon Select Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Glen Fiona,Red,Puncheon Select,,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$20,85,Paul Gregutt,"Much of a piece with its companion releases, this is done in a lighter style, with plum and berry fruit, dried herbs and a short, simple finish."
Gualdo del Re 2007 Eliseo Red (Val di Cornia Suvereto),Gualdo del Re,Red,Eliseo,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Val di Cornia Suvereto, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$28,87,,"Easygoing and fresh, this ruby-colored wine offers sweet cherry nuances with lighter aromas of almond and ground cinnamon. It's a cheerful and sunny wine that shows good integrity of fruit and a clean, crisp finish."
Robert Mondavi 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Robert Mondavi,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$35,85,,"Smells sharp and minty, with a green streak of raw oak, and tastes similarly thin and oaky.  It stings with tannins from entry through dusty finish.  Blackberry and plum flavors deep inside are smothered in tannins."
William Rose 2018 Pinot Blanc (Oregon),William Rose,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",13.5%,$28,87,Paul Gregutt,"Tart and dry, this brings a dusty note across a range of tangy citrus fruits, particularly lemon and grapefruit. The acids are emphasized somewhat by an astringent, chalky finish."
Terrazas de Los Andes 2008 Chardonnay (Mendoza),Terrazas de Los Andes,White,,Chardonnay,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,,83,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of apple cider are a touch acrid, while the palate is wet and easy but low in acidity. Flavors of melon and white fruits show some bitterness and break up in front of a flat finish."
Château Fonplégade 2018  Saint-Émilion,Château Fonplégade,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",14.5%,$60,93,Roger Voss,"This well-balanced wine is ripe, with dense black fruits shot through with ageworthy tannins. Poised and already offering fruitiness and ripeness built for long-term aging, this wine will be ready from 2026. Organic and biodynamic."
Glenora 2012 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Glenora,White,Barrel Fermented,Chardonnay,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",14%,$16,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Zest and floral notes abound on this refreshingly dry Chardonnay. Satisfyingly juicy and tart, it's penetrating on the palate with flavors of white grapefruit and fresh green apple. Finishes briskly but with a lingering lime-skin astringency."
Domaine Charles Frey 2016 Quintessence Pinot Noir (Alsace),Domaine Charles Frey,Red,Quintessence,Pinot Noir,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$40,90,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Vanilla and polished mahogany frame the cherry core on the nose of this wine. The slender palate is smooth, with mellow vanilla tones that embrace those tart, bright cherry notes."
Naggiar 2013 Mamma Mia Estate White (Sierra Foothills),Naggiar,White,Mamma Mia Estate,White Blend,"Sierra Foothills, Sierra Foothills, California, US",13.8%,$23,87,Jim Gordon,"Full body and savory flavors set this apart from the crowd, bringing a melon and almond aroma and subtle flavors like fig and butter. With a dry feel, creamy texture and lingering finish it tastes more serious than the name suggests."
Cantalici L'Antica Fornace di Ridolfo 2013 Baruffo Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Cantalici L'Antica Fornace di Ridolfo,Red,Baruffo Riserva,Sangiovese,"Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$40,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Underbrush, cooking spice and a touch of iris aromas unfold in the glass. The concentrated palate offers ripe black cherry, licorice, tobacco and a hint of mocha alongside fine-grained tannins."
Marine Layer 2018 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),Marine Layer,White,Gap's Crown Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",13.2%,$50,92,Virginie Boone,"Tropical and lushly textured, this wine presents as full and fleshy, with a fruitiness that appeals. Balanced acidity helps counter and complement its more opulent tendencies, pulling it back into a freshness of sea spray and mountain air."
Edgewood 2000 Malbec (Napa Valley),Edgewood,Red,,Malbec,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$20,87,,"An interesting wine very similar to a classic Napa Cabernet. Has those lush, smooth tannins, gorgeous, velvety texture and long finish, accented with oaky vanillins and smoke. The flavors are distinctive, like a gooey black cherry pie whose rich sweetness lasts for a long time."
Château Julien 2000 Barrel Aged Zinfandel (Monterey County),Château Julien,Red,Barrel Aged,Zinfandel,"Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$10,85,,"Kicks off with pretty toast and oak notes, followed by hints of blackberry, spice, plum and anise flavors. It's a bit tart on the finish, however."
Clos La Chance 2013 Hadley's Cuvee White (Central Coast),Clos La Chance,White,Hadley's Cuvee,White Blend,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",14.8%,$22,89,Matt Kettmann,"It's uncommon to find Grenache Noir in a white blend, but it's a tasty experiment nonetheless. Well rounded and evenly presented, the nose of lemon and honeysuckle is prominent but delicate. The slightly oily palate comes alive with vanilla, pear candy, peach and bubblegum, finishing with a brush of acidity."
Left Bend 2014 Muns Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),Left Bend,Red,Muns Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Cruz Mountains, Central Coast, California, US",14.2%,$40,88,Matt Kettmann,"Potpourri, ripe strawberries and a touch of cedar show on the nose of this single-vineyard expression. The palate offers baked berries, sandalwood and dried melons, and the texture is a little bit flat."
Boomtown 2014 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Boomtown,Red,,,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.9%,$19,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"Dark berry, huckleberry, wood spice and cocoa aromas are followed by palate-coating blue and purple-fruit flavors."
Merry Cellars 2014 Seven Hills Vineyard Carmenère (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Merry Cellars,Red,Seven Hills Vineyard,Carmenère,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$36,87,Sean P. Sullivan,"Raw, sliced banana pepper, ground black-pepper, cinnamon and green-herb aromas lead to plump front-loaded cherry and pepper flavors that don't entirely stay together throughout. Cranberry notes linger on the finish."
Château la Caminade 2015 Mission la Caminade  (Cahors),Château la Caminade,Red,Mission la Caminade,"Malbec-Merlot, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Cahors, Southwest France, France",13%,$12,88,Roger Voss,"Ready to drink, this classic combination holds 15% Merlot that tames the 85% Malbec. It's a friendly, black-fruit-flavored wine with integrated tannins and an aftertaste with juicy acidity. Drink now."
Wayne Thomas 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),Wayne Thomas,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",13.5%,$22,90,Joe Czerwinski,"Veteran winemaker Wayne Thomas has crafted a prototypical Australian Cabernet, mingling mint and eucalyptus notes with cassis fruit and a touch of chocolaty oak. The texture is creamy enough to suggest early drinkability, yet there are also velvety-dusty tannins that should enable the wine to develop over the next several years."
Réthoré Davy 2018 Chapitre Pinot Gris (Val de Loire),Réthoré Davy,White,Chapitre,,"Val de Loire, Loire Valley, France",12.5%,$15,86,Roger Voss,"This attractive, perfumed wine offers apple flavors that convey both warmth and freshness. Drink this refreshing wine now."
Mier Vini 2006 Nero Latino Aglianico (Irpinia),Mier Vini,Red,Nero Latino,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Irpinia, Southern Italy, Italy",,,83,,"Nero Latino lacks harmony overall because of its rapid succession of unrelated aromas: Red apple is followed by mushroom, beets, strawberry, chocolate and smoke. It also has an extremely strong component of coffee rinds that appears on both the nose and in the mouth. It's not a wine for everyone."
Perrin & Fils 1999  Crozes-Hermitage,Perrin & Fils,Red,,,"Crozes-Hermitage, Rhône Valley, France",12.5%,$24,87,,"Though there's no denying that Perrin's bouquet is full of dark berries, cherry and plum, tasters also detected a fresh, grassy-peach note. The palate is less sunny, and fraught with tart red fruit and tangy oak. It's a little hard now, and will probably improve after a year or two in the cellar; we still wish that it had a little more complexity. Finishes dry, with toast and crisp tannins."
Apothic 2014 Crush Smooth Red (California),Apothic,Red,Crush Smooth,"Red Blends, Red Blends","California, California Other, California, US",14.5%,$14,86,Jim Gordon,"A darkly fruity aroma leads to sweet flavors like brown sugar, milk chocolate and blueberry jam in this medium-bodied, soft-textured wine."
Fossil Point 2012 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),Fossil Point,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$17,86,Matt Kettmann,"Sagebrush aromas lead off this bottling from the newish Fossil Point label, which is connected to the higher end Center of Effort brand. On the palate, spice, tar and pomegranate accompany some fairly weighty tannins, meaning that this will probably emerge as a better wine by 2016."
Mission Hill 2012 Lone Pine Chardonnay (Okanagan Valley),Mission Hill,White,Lone Pine,Chardonnay,,13%,$40,88,Paul Gregutt,"At first this is a spicy, forward wine, with generous flavors of candied fruits, orange peel and baked pear. It offers cinnamon highlights along with moderate toast. The downside? The wine seems to flatten out quickly through the finish, suggesting that it's best to drink up."
Whidbey Island Winery 2005 Merlot (Yakima Valley),Whidbey Island Winery,Red,,Merlot,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$15,88,Paul Gregutt,"Here is a good value effort, smoky, chewy and dense, with strong flavors but solid Merlot varietal character. There is unusual smokiness in the wine—presumably from barrel toast—but enough ripe fruit to offset that and the substantial tannins. The spicy finish suggests American oak barrels were used."
Masciarelli 2015 Marina Cvetic Riserva  (Trebbiano d'Abruzzo),Masciarelli,White,Marina Cvetic Riserva,"Trebbiano, Italian White","Trebbiano d'Abruzzo, Central Italy, Italy",14.5%,$50,91,Alexander Peartree,"A mix of grilled pineapple, citrus oil and sea spray starts off this rich white. Time in oak is apparent yet integrated, offering a delicate brûléed edge to the citrus, pineapple and apricot flavors. Persistent acidity balances it all, leading to a lingering cured lemon finish."
Morell-Peña 2017 Ysabella Bjork Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Morell-Peña,White,Ysabella Bjork,Chardonnay,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.9%,$60,91,Sean P. Sullivan,"This is all clone 96 Chardonnay. Clarified butter, cream, lemon balm and crayon aromas are followed by creamy candlewax flavors that sail. Toasty notes linger on the finish. Variety and winemaker influence walk hand in hand."
Thurston Wolfe 2009 PGV White (Washington),Thurston Wolfe,White,PGV,White Blend,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$16,90,Paul Gregutt,"In 2009, it's the Pinot Gris (at 60%) that dominates this two-grape blend; the rest is Viognier. It's always a delicious wine, and here again the two grapes match up beautifully, with the Pinot Gris bringing flesh and rind from a variety of citrus fruits, and the Viognier adding orange blossom and tangerine."
San Lorenzo 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,San Lorenzo,Red,,"Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese","Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",,$55,92,,"Compared to the less remarkable vintages of the past, San Lorenzo's 2004 Brunello represents a complete about face. This is a gorgeous wine with bold aromas of blackberries, spice, smoke and moist tobacco. The finish is enduring and fresh, and it gives the wine an attractively firm and elongated feel."
Vignerons des Terres Secrètes 2008 Cuvée Delaye les Pierres Grises  (Saint-Véran),Vignerons des Terres Secrètes,White,Cuvée Delaye les Pierres Grises,Chardonnay,"Saint-Véran, Burgundy, France",13%,$17,84,Roger Voss,"Hard-edged wine, with wood flavors dominant over the steely fruit character. It is very structured, perhaps too much."
Sileni 2017 Plateau Reserve Pinot Noir (Hawke's Bay),Sileni,Red,Plateau Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Hawke's Bay, New Zealand",,$20,86,Christina Pickard,"This starts on the soapy, synthetic side, but these qualities do blow off some with time in glass. There's plenty of cherry fruit here too, along with floral, orange rind, Middle Eastern spice and dusty oak aromas. Gritty in texture and medium in weight, the palate tastes of tangy fruit and oak and finishes a touch bitter. This sturdy wine lacks some of the verve and brightness of the variety."
Telaya 2013 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),Telaya,White,,Viognier,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.7%,$17,85,Sean P. Sullivan,"Aromas of pear, stone fruit and lees lead to peach and floral flavors. The concentration is light and elegant."
Poeira 2014 White (Douro),Poeira,White,,Portuguese White,"Douro, Portugal",,,92,Roger Voss,"This is a wood aged wine, full of vanilla flavors as well as fragrant fruitiness. It has great flavor intensity, with bright notes of juicy green plum and grapefruit that are framed by acidity and a tight, mineral texture. It needs some years aging, so drink from 2018."
Domaines Ott 2017 Château Romassan Rosé (Bandol),Domaines Ott,Rose,Château Romassan,Rosé,"Bandol, Provence, France",13.5%,$55,93,Roger Voss,"With the Bandol's very own Mourvèdre dominating the blend of this wine, it has a spicy character, with layers of tannins as well as rich red-currant and berry fruits. It's a complex wine, offering pure fruit but with elegance and a rich aftertaste. Drink from late 2018."
Landmark 2011 Kiser Chardonnay (Carneros),Landmark,White,Kiser,Chardonnay,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$40,91,,"This Chardonnay is barrel fermented, aged on the lees and spends additional time in the barrel, all resulting in a big, honeyed wine. It is tremendously rich, on top of the underlying ripe fruit flavors of mangoes and peaches. Excellent acidity and firm minerality add complexity."
Ropiteau 2019 Les Plants Nobles Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Ropiteau,Red,Les Plants Nobles,Pinot Noir,"Vin de France, France Other, France",14%,$10,85,Fiona Adams,"The aroma brings together cranberry and violet, leading to a light and fruity palate of plum, cranberry and pomegranate. Soft tannins and lazy acidity."

Caramel, baked cherry, cedar and tight-grained tannins are just the beginning of a complex, layered and complicated journey of intense balance and savory character."
Pierre Sparr 2018 One White (Alsace),Pierre Sparr,White,One,White Blend,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12%,$17,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"An exotic nose lends notes of sandalwood, rosewater and spice. The palate of this wine stays light, translucent and bright, shimmering with freshness and aromatics on the easy, light body. It finishes fresh and dry."
Conn Creek 2003 Anthology Red (Napa Valley),Conn Creek,Red,Anthology,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.3%,$54,87,,"A blend of all five Bordeaux reds, this is a very ripe, soft wine, brimming with cherry, chocolate, pecan pie and oak flavors. It doesn't seem like an ager, but rewards now for its lushness."
Friedeman 2017 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Friedeman,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.3%,$40,93,Virginie Boone,"This commingles grapes from Lancel Creek, Terra de Promissio and Estines vineyards, all single-vineyard designates in their own right. Together, they offer floral notes of rose and lavender within exotic forested wood, dried herb, cardamom and blood orange. The whole is balanced and silky smooth."
Mercer 2016 Edge of Heaven Blend Red (Horse Heaven Hills),Mercer,Red,Edge of Heaven Blend,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.9%,$20,84,Sean P. Sullivan,"Quite dried out-seeming aromas of raspberry, vanilla and cherry are followed by ripe fruit flavors that also seem desiccated. The concentration comes off as quite light."
Montes 2009 Taita Red (Colchagua Valley),Montes,Red,Taita,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Colchagua Valley, Chile",15%,$300,93,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of spice, vanilla and wood are stronger than this wine's fruit scents. Pure and lush on the palate, this is showing fine balance. Flavors of baking spices, caramel, vanilla and black fruits finish mildly and subtly, with mocha notes and good length. Drink this ripe Cabernet blend through 2019."
Trenel Fils 2010 Côte du Py  (Morgon),Trenel Fils,Red,Côte du Py,Gamay,"Morgon, Beaujolais, France",13%,$24,91,Roger Voss,"The sense of structure that is so evident in 2010 wines is particularly apparent in this perfumed, rich and firmly tannic selection. It shows the hard edges of granite soil, plus juicy red fruit. Concentrated and complex, it needs several years to mature."
Stolpman 2018 The Great Places Ruben Solorzano Syrah (Ballard Canyon),Stolpman,Red,The Great Places Ruben Solorzano,,"Ballard Canyon, Central Coast, California, US",14%,$98,94,Matt Kettmann,"This special bottling in honor of vineyard manager Ruben Solorzano begins with aromas of roasted boysenberry, black pepper and crumpled purple flowers. There's a rustic, almost gritty tannic structure to the sip, which will smooth with time to allow the spicy black-pepper, strong acidity and jammy fruit flavors to better coalesce. Drink 2023–2038."
Ashan 2012 Kestrel Vineyard Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),Ashan,White,Kestrel Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.9%,$45,95,Paul Gregutt,"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay, from the oldest plantings (1972) in Washington State, displays exceptional concentration and palate weight. Apple pie, pear tart, baking spice, butter and caramel flavors abound. It's rich and packed with fruit, along with the seductive flavors that aging in new French oak can provide."
L'Ecole No. 41 2019 Frenchtown Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),L'Ecole No. 41,Red,Frenchtown,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$22,91,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas aren't fully ready to reveal their charms, with notes of spice, plum and cherry. The flavors are plump, ripe, and show pleasing purity and depth, with the mouthfeel upping the appeal. It's a lot of wine for the money. Give it a short decant."
Carabella 2000 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Carabella,White,,,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$14,86,Paul Gregutt,"An unusual style, with light scents of fennel leading into intriguing flavors of caraway, arugula and pear. However, after a promising start, the wine fades quickly into a light, tart finish."
Frescobaldi 2015 Tenuta Perano Rialzi Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),Frescobaldi,Red,Tenuta Perano Rialzi Gran Selezione,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$60,92,Kerin O’Keefe,"Pipe-tobacco, baked plum and blue-flower aromas mingle with camphor and coconut while the austere palate features dried cherry, pomegranate, licorice and a hint of espresso. Close-grained tannins give it a drying finish."
Château du Taillan 2011 La Dame Blanche  (Bordeaux Blanc),Château du Taillan,White,La Dame Blanche,Sauvignon Blanc,"Bordeaux Blanc, Bordeaux, France",,$20,85,Roger Voss,"This is a bright, fruity, rounded wine with a soft texture. It's full and ripe, with melon and green plum notes, plus a touch of bitterness on the finish."
Dante Robere 2017 Zinfandel (San Francisco Bay),Dante Robere,Red,,Zinfandel,"San Francisco Bay, Central Coast, California, US",15.4%,$38,87,Jim Gordon,"Wood smoke, black pepper and clove aromas lead to powerful, grapey, blackberry-like flavors in this firm and tannic wine aged in all new oak barrels. It is concentrated, oaky and mouth-puckering."

It's ripe and concentrated, with a dry, lemony zing that lingers until the very last echo."
Chehalem 2014 Stoller Vineyard Ian's Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),Chehalem,White,Stoller Vineyard Ian's Reserve,Chardonnay,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$40,90,Paul Gregutt,"Back in fine form, this shows crisp and fresh apple, white peach and green melon fruit. Aged in 41% new and 25% one-year-old oak, it's not especially toasty, but has the concentration and balance to develop well over the next six to eight years."
Navarro 2018 Estate Bottled Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),Navarro,White,Estate Bottled,Gewürztraminer,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",13.5%,$25,89,Jim Gordon,"This dry (or nearly dry) wine is lively and well-balanced, fresh and appetizing.

Henschke 2002 Lenswood Abbotts Prayer Red (Adelaide Hills),Henschke,Red,Lenswood Abbotts Prayer,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Adelaide Hills, South Australia, Australia",14%,$70,87,,"This is an enjoyable wine, one with coffee and caramel accents on the nose, and plum, berry and oak flavors. It's hard not to like, but at this price, shouldn't it be love at first sight? Merlot, with some Cab Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Imported by Negociants USA, Inc."
Domaine Dujac 2009 Les Malconsorts  (Vosne-Romanée),Domaine Dujac,Red,Les Malconsorts,Pinot Noir,"Vosne-Romanée, Burgundy, France",,$276,94,Roger Voss,"All tannins and black fruits, this is a powerful wine.

The Four Graces 2014 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),The Four Graces,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.1%,$24,92,Paul Gregutt,"This is a thrilling example of just how good Oregon Pinot Blanc can be.

Wolf Blass 2002 Platinum Label Shiraz (Barossa),Wolf Blass,Red,Platinum Label,,"Barossa, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$72,90,,"Light maple, grape jelly and meaty aromas are succeeded by berry-basket flavors on the palate.

Lamblin & Fils 2018 Vaillon Premier Cru  (Chablis),Lamblin & Fils,White,Vaillon Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Chablis, Burgundy, France",13%,$60,91,Roger Voss,"This premier cru, from the 18th generation of the Lamblin family, has produced a crisp, cool wine with some steely acidity from vines on the left bank of the Serein river.

Manolesaki 2002 Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay White (Drama),Manolesaki,White,Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay,White Blend,"Drama, Greece",12%,$22,85,Joe Czerwinski,"This interesting blend boasts aromas of preserved lemons and fresh herbs, then turns a bit plumper in the mouth, with nectarine flavors joining in. Tart and high-acid on the finish, making it a natural with oily seafood dishes like fresh sardines."
RedHeads 2016 Corroboree Shiraz (Barossa Valley-Clare Valley),RedHeads,Red,Corroboree,,"Barossa Valley-Clare Valley, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$24,86,Christina Pickard,"This is an ultraripe, full-throttle wine oozing raspberry jam and floral dish soap aromas along with a fair whack of peppery oak. The ripeness and oak influence continues on the palate. It's just barely saved by lifted acidity."
Quinta do Monte Xisto 2018 Red (Douro),Quinta do Monte Xisto,Red,,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",13.5%,$60,95,Roger Voss,"Produced in one of the most spectacular of the Douro's many spectacular vineyards, this wine is a serious structure of ripe black fruits and dark tannins. The fruit is going to yield a smooth, concentrated, juicy and smoky wine. Likely to take its tine, this major wine is impressive in its richness. Drink from 2025."
Husch 2003 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Husch,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",,$21,90,,"This is a very pure, clear Pinot Noir. It doesn't have a lot of alcohol, extract or oak. It's ripe in cherries and blueberries, but not overripe. The acidity is bright and the mouthfeel is silky. In other words, it's super-drinkable."
Cantine Valenti 2013 Enrico IV Bianco  (Etna),Cantine Valenti,White,Enrico IV Bianco,"Carricante, Italian White","Etna, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",12.5%,$25,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"An attractive floral fragrance of peach blossom, cherry blossom, lychee and broom take shape in the glass.

It straddles the border between dry and off-dry, and is easy to like with Vietnamese and Cambodian fare."
Clarendon Hills 2004 Brookman Cabernet Sauvignon (Clarendon),Clarendon Hills,Red,Brookman,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Clarendon, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$65,91,,"Shows tons of beautiful red and black berries on the nose, which carry over to the palate in the form of juicy, perfectly ripe flavors tinged with just a hint of graham cracker. Acidity is lively; can be enjoyed now through 2011."
Chimney Rock 2012 Tomahawk Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Chimney Rock,Red,Tomahawk Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Stags Leap District, Napa, California, US",14.5%,,92,Virginie Boone,"From an estate-grown, valley-floor vineyard on the southern edges of the winery property, this wine is complex and nuanced in berry pie and a satchel of dried herb.

NoCurfew 2020 Chardonnay (California),NoCurfew,White,,Chardonnay,"California, California Other, California, US",13.8%,$12,86,Jim Gordon,An earthy overtone and moderate fruit flavors make a decent combination in this medium-bodied and straightforward wine.
Reilly's 2004 Old Bushvine Grenache (Clare Valley),Reilly's,Red,Old Bushvine,Grenache,"Clare Valley, South Australia, Australia",15%,$19,91,Joe Czerwinski,"Reilly's Clare Valley location tends to give its wines a little more focus than some of the wines coming out of nearby Barossa, like in this fine example of old vine Grenache. Aromas of brandied cherries sprinkled with star anise add touches of chocolate and earth on the palate. It's full, round and generous, yet finishes firm and focused. Drink now and over the next few years."
Franklin Tate 2013 Tate Chardonnay (Margaret River),Franklin Tate,White,Tate,Chardonnay,"Margaret River, Western Australia, Australia",13.5%,$15,90,Joe Czerwinski,"This is a pretty lean, tightly focused wine. Grilled pineapple and citrus notes broaden slightly on the midpalate, then come together again on the crisp, lemony finish. Drink now through the end of 2015."
Falesco 2007 Ferentano Roscetto (Lazio),Falesco,White,Ferentano,"Roscetto, Italian White","Lazio, Central Italy, Italy",13.5%,$23,89,,"Ferentano is a luscious and rich white wine that shows enough structure and staying power to pair with roast pork or turkey and gravy. It boasts a round, soft and supple texture backed by thick density."
Jacquart NV Brut Mosaïque  (Champagne),Jacquart,Sparkling,Brut Mosaïque,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12.5%,,87,Roger Voss,"The style of Jacquart's nonvintage Champagne is rich, ripe and full bodied.

Colmello di Grotta 2016 Sauvignon (Collio),Colmello di Grotta,White,,"Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc","Collio, Northeastern Italy, Italy",12%,$25,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Tropical fruit, crushed herb, red bell pepper and fragrant white flower are just some of the aromas you'll find on this expressive white. On the juicy palate, fresh acidity brightens white peach and grapefruit while a note of white pepper lifts the finish."
Napa Cellars 2014 Classic Collection Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Napa Cellars,White,Classic Collection,Chardonnay,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.9%,$22,86,Virginie Boone,"A hearty cradling of oak provides a tinge of vanilla sweetness here, before richer notions of apple pie and cinnamon tug at the wine's fuller-bodied core. It'll appeal to fans of this richer, riper style, while still finishing in a measure of acidity."
Peter Cellars 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),Peter Cellars,Red,Estate,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",13.9%,$31,85,Virginie Boone,"This is a leathery, thick and robust wine that shows more presence of black tea and tannin than tang of fruit."
Castello di Radda 2006 Poggio Selvale Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Castello di Radda,Red,Poggio Selvale Riserva,Sangiovese,"Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",,,88,,"There's a nice balance here between red fruit and cherries with spice and tobacco. In the background, you'll pick up subtle shadings of green leaf or dried mint with smoky mineral notes on the close. The mouthfeel is dry and textured. Only 250 cases made."
Château Haut Peyrat 2016 Prélude  (Bordeaux Supérieur),Château Haut Peyrat,Red,Prélude,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux Supérieur, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$40,87,Roger Voss,"A blend dominated by Merlot, this wine is all about fruit.

Easton 2010 Monarch Mine Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Sierra Foothills),Easton,White,Monarch Mine Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sierra Foothills, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14%,$18,92,Virginie Boone,"This crisp white is inviting and dry, with aromas of citrus, fig and fennel. Reminiscent of a fine Sancerre, it's finely structured, steely and still lushly textured and full enough in the mouth to enjoy with seafood, a creamy goat cheese salad or entirely on its own."
Erath 2009 Niederberger Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Erath,Red,Niederberger,Pinot Noir,"Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.5%,$50,92,Paul Gregutt,"A dark streak runs straight through this excellent Pinot.

Domaine Alfred 2005 Chamisal Vineyards Chardonnay (Edna Valley),Domaine Alfred,Red,Chamisal Vineyards,Chardonnay,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",,$24,88,,"Lots of acidity in this crunchy wine; this is so tart it's almost like fresh-squeezed lime juice. Fortunately, creamy lees and plenty of new oak add softer, sweeter notes of buttered toast and vanilla."
Roagna 2000 Pajé  (Barbaresco),Roagna,Red,Pajé,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",13.5%,$60,88,,"This vintage of Barbaresco from the excellent Pajé cru is very focused on wild strawberries, red currant and cassis but behind the fruit you will find white mineral, ash and smoke. The mouthfeel is compact and firm but much of the pulpy fruit here has since evolved. The wine is ready to drink and would pair with risotto and white truffles."
Renteria 2013 Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),Renteria,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Los Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$40,90,Virginie Boone,"Candied cherry, strawberry and a bright minerality highlight this wine, with additional accents of herb and earth.

Valentín Bianchi 2011 Elsa Chardonnay (Mendoza),Valentín Bianchi,White,Elsa,Chardonnay,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13%,$10,84,Michael Schachner,"Apple and white fruit aromas set up a balanced, reasonably full palate, with banana, creamy oak, vanilla and apple flavors. It feels solid and round, with a clean finish."
Barrister 2009 Klipsun Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Red Mountain),Barrister,White,Klipsun Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$19,91,Paul Gregutt,"A tasty, round, nicely-balanced, fruity style.

There's a solid tension to the sip, which frames the ripe and accessible yet tart red fruits, with aromatic lavender touches lifting the entire  experience."
Upland Estates 2007 Gewürztraminer (Snipes Mountain),Upland Estates,White,,Gewürztraminer,"Snipes Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$14,90,Paul Gregutt,"Ripe and spicy, this is a very rich and fruity Gewürz, with moderate sweetness (1.6% residual sugar). Melon, mango, candied orange peel dominate, it's round and tasty, without the soapy or oily quality of the variety."
Silver Lake 2008 Roza Hills Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay (Rattlesnake Hills),Silver Lake,White,Roza Hills Vineyard Reserve,Chardonnay,"Rattlesnake Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$12,88,Paul Gregutt,"An exceptional value, this is buttery and round, loaded with peaches and creamy vanilla flavors.

Red Stitch 2013 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Red Stitch,Red,Soberanes Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$54,91,Matt Kettmann,"This wine from an ownership team of former pro baseballers Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts is plush on the nose with dried strawberry, gingerbread and baking spices.

Villa del Lago 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Villa del Lago,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15.4%,$225,93,,"This starts out a bit coarse, with strong tannins that have a rough-edged feeling. It's very rich in blackberries and black currants, but showing more power than elegance. Time in the glass certainly opens it up, revealing a rich, heady cassis note. While the alcohol is high, it may easily develop bottle complexity over the next 10–15 years."
Grey Wolf Cellars 2015 Instinctual Grenache (Paso Robles),Grey Wolf Cellars,Red,Instinctual,Grenache,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15.2%,$44,90,Matt Kettmann,"Slightly stewed aromas of red-cherry syrup meet with gravel and wet earth on the nose of this bottling.

Sattui,White,,Chardonnay,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.8%,$29,88,Virginie Boone,"Floral streaks of orange blossom open this wine, followed by vibrant bursts of lemon.

Château de Marsan 2011  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,Château de Marsan,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",,$19,85,Roger Voss,"A fragrant, fruity wine, with fruit tannins, just a hint of wood and tight black-currant fruit. This is a dry wine, firm at the center and needing a year to round out."

A full chunky palate is more dense than expansive, while this tastes of baked plum and prune. Hard tannins are drawing on a full-size finish. Drink the ripest and heaviest of Garage's 2014 Carignans through 2021."
Fournier Père et Fils 2016 Côtes de Morogues  (Menetou-Salon),Fournier Père et Fils,White,Côtes de Morogues,Sauvignon Blanc,"Menetou-Salon, Loire Valley, France",12.5%,$20,89,Roger Voss,"This is a delicious wine— a soft generous style of Sauvignon Blanc.

Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",16.2%,$52.50,87,Matt Kettmann,"Deep and dark aromas of blackberry, elderberry, black plum and clove show on the nose of this bottling.

There is a strong acidic tang to the palate, where macerated strawberry flavors feel quite fresh and young. It goes down easy."

Bastos Grande Reserva,"Alicante Bouschet, Other Red","Alentejo, Portugal",14%,$145,93,Roger Voss,"Pure Alicante Bouschet, now mature, reveals the depths of flavor of this grape variety. The wine has a smoky character and tannins that are fully integrated into the fruit and acidity. Its structure has softened while leaving a fresh kick and touches of licorice. Drink this fine wine now."

Le Vieux Pin 2012 Ava White (Okanagan Valley),Le Vieux Pin,White,Ava,Rhône-style White Blend,,14%,$35,93,Paul Gregutt,"A brilliant blend of 61% Viognier, 21% Roussanne and 18% Marsanne, this impresses with its proportion, tension and balance. Scents and flavors meld citrus oil and rind, fruit flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and Meyer lemon, and a lovely finish with highlights of English breakfast tea.

Lemelson 2006 Jerome Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Lemelson,Red,Jerome Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$58,92,Paul Gregutt,"This complex wine lists no fewer than eight different clones in the blend, harvested at an average of just 1.8 tons/acre. The winery suggests that it is their most ageworthy Pinot Noir, and the structure of this young wine would support that assertion. It's tight, hard, compact with black fruits, smoke and chewy tannins. It's a wine that needs time to stretch its considerable muscles. The roughly 50/50 mix of new and once-used barrels adds baking chocolate, licorice and charred toast to the finish; well-integrated and buttressed with crisp acids. But the lingering flavor is of raspberry jam; so good you want to spread it directly on your tongue."
Cousiño-Macul 2004 Antiguas Reservas Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),Cousiño-Macul,White,Antiguas Reservas,Chardonnay,"Maipo Valley, Chile",,$14,87,Michael Schachner,"Quite round and chewy, but zesty enough to stay on balance.

Michel Torino 2009 Don David Reserve Malbec (Calchaquí Valley),Michel Torino,Red,Don David Reserve,Malbec,"Calchaquí Valley, Other, Argentina",13.9%,$16,84,Michael Schachner,"A disjointed, out-of-the-box Malbec that starts out peanutty and earthy on the nose. Things round out aromatically, but in the mouth it's angular and edgy, with stunted blackberry flavors offset by tartness. Has its positives but overall it doesn't fully click."
Wente 2017 Riverbank Riesling (Arroyo Seco),Wente,White,Riverbank,Riesling,"Arroyo Seco, Central Coast, California, US",13%,$18,88,Matt Kettmann,"Key lime, wet stone and a steely minerality show on the crisp nose of this bottling.

Melrose 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Umpqua Valley),Melrose,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Umpqua Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",14%,$16,89,Paul Gregutt,"Showing just a hint of sweetness, this well-rounded effort offers a ripe and tangy mix of lime, grapefruit, pineapple and white peach fruit flavors. There's a touch of honey running alongside and trickling out through the finish. It's drinking at or near its peak."
Double Canyon 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),Double Canyon,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.7%,$25,91,Sean P. Sullivan,"A new offering from the winery, this includes Syrah (13%) and Malbec (3%) in the mix. It's direct and appealing in notes of blueberry, cherry and well-placed vanilla accents.

Kaesler 2005 The Bogan Shiraz (Barossa Valley),Kaesler,Red,The Bogan,,"Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",,$65,93,Joe Czerwinski,"Big and bold, like the excellent '04 version. If anything, it emphasizes the fruit even a bit more, with less spicy complexity, but it's a black hole of plum and blackberry fruit that explodes in the mouth, staining the palate with fruity intensity. The alcohol level must be elevated, but it's well concealed by supple tannins. Drink now–2015."
Laurenz V. 2004 Laurenz and Sophie Singing Grüner Veltliner (Austria),Laurenz V.,White,Laurenz and Sophie Singing,Grüner Veltliner,"Austria, Austria",12.5%,$13,86,Joe Czerwinski,"This well-priced wine boasts ripe aromas of nectarine and lime, then delivers more stone fruit on the palate.

Lagar de Cervera 2019 Albariño (Rías Baixas),Lagar de Cervera,White,,Albariño,"Rías Baixas, Galicia, Spain",12.5%,$17,90,Michael Schachner,"Pear and yellow apple aromas include hints of wet stone and vanilla.

Neirano 1995  Barolo,Neirano,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",13.5%,$18,86,,"This is a Barolo you could probably enjoy tonight with dinner. Its leathery aromas mixed with a mature touch of forest and roasted fruit say “I'm ready.” Medium-bodied and not too tannic, it has a full and ripe cherry flavor, an attribute for an early-drinker such as this."
Legado del Moncayo 2016 Garnacha Blanca (Campo de Borja),Legado del Moncayo,White,,"Garnacha Blanca, Spanish White","Campo de Borja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$15,86,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of clover and yeasty vanilla lack concentration.

Damiani 2010 Meritage (Finger Lakes),Damiani,Red,,"Meritage, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",13.7%,$27,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Toast and spice notes add warmth to crisp blackberry and cassis on this elegantly composed Meritage.

Taut and racy, the linear palate offers sour cherry, cranberry, powdered sage and a hint of clove set against vibrant acidity. Tight, rather grainy tannins grip the close."
Macchia 2012 Lodi Native Noma Ranch Zinfandel (Mokelumne River),Macchia,Red,Lodi Native Noma Ranch,Zinfandel,"Mokelumne River, Central Valley, California, US",15.8%,$35,92,Jim Gordon,"Very full-bodied it carries a gorgeous ripe blackberry character from the first whiff to the long, lingering finish.

Ektimo Vineyards 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Bennett Valley),Ektimo Vineyards,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Bennett Valley, Sonoma, California, US",15.6%,$18,80,Virginie Boone,"This wine has a rustic, unclean quality. At a high alcohol level it also tastes disjointed, all about heat without fruit."

Cueto 2004  Rioja,Cueto,Red,,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",,$10,80,Michael Schachner,"Jammy and sweet on the nose, like a jar of strawberry preserves. The palate, however, is light and tart, with burnt berry flavors. Finishes peppery and short, with little to latch onto."

It's a pleasant surprise, as it lends levity and definition to the notes of black cherry, crushed purple flowers, licorice root and earth. The mouthfeel is plush and mouthfilling, yet not oppressively so, with ample acidity and structured but velvety tannins. The rich, ripe and robust palate leads into a long finish.

Michelle,Red,Mimi,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,VivinoWine.com,87,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas are unusual, with notes of scorched earth and soil, showing reduction that distracts. Over time, bittersweet chocolate, cherry and herb notes emerge.

While it sits firmly in premium territory—and could easily age for the next 10 years—this Pinot is undeniably approachable now. The nose offers heady aromas of red and black berries, beets, vanilla, hot chocolate, Middle Eastern spices and stalky cinnamon. The palate is elegant and tightly wound, with an earthy core and a savory finish."

Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$50,92,Matt Kettmann,"A bright and sour combination strikes the nose on this wine, with aromas of lime sorbet, kumquat and salted green apple rinds. The lean, focused and racy palate is led by crushed limestone grip, with the slight warmth of tart crab apples, proving quite palate cleansing. It's perfect for halibut or other delicate fish."

O. Fournier 2008 Red (Maule Valley),O. Fournier,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Maule Valley, Chile",14.5%,$85,90,Michael Schachner,"Like most O. Fournier signature reds, this is dark, extracted and modern in style. The bouquet is full of rubber, marzipan, exotic spice and lemon-like aromas. It shows a rawness on the palate along with toasty dark-berry and lemon flavors. The finish is oaky, with tangy acids and a spot of heat.

It's a nutty, smokey, toasty, melony beauty. Perfectly in balance, with a chalky texture and medium to light body, it wears its heart on its sleeve and is drinking perfectly now, but will gain more even more complexity with a few years in bottle. Drink now–2022."

Sullivan,"The aromas deliver notes of green pepper, parsley, barrel spice, cherry cordial, fresh herb and anise. The palate brings an assortment of plush red and black-fruit flavors, with slightly dry tannins on the finish. It's quite well made but it comes off as a little green and astringent at present."

It's an exotic wine, spicy and peppery, almost briary, like a Zinfandel, except with flavors of wild forest raspberries, cherries, orange zest and a hint of pine cone. It's as cellarable a Pinot Noir as exists in California. Best after 2015."
Joseph Drouhin 2010 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru  (Beaune),Joseph Drouhin,White,Clos des Mouches Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Beaune, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$120,94,Roger Voss,"Round and soft initially, this rich, intense Chardonnay then shows its firm side.

Quinta do Pinto 2017 Syrah Syrah (Lisboa),Quinta do Pinto,Red,Syrah,,"Lisboa, Portugal",15%,$28,94,Roger Voss,"This is a spicy, lusciously fruity wine.

It's a sweet wine, with sugary flavors of cherry pie filling, raspberry tart, chocolate and cassis-infused crème brûlée, finished with a crisp dose of acidity. Likeable for its balance, it makes a nice after-dinner or late night conclusion to a long, hard day."

Vasse Felix 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),Vasse Felix,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Margaret River, Western Australia, Australia",,$30,92,,"Almost black in color, an infantile wine whose aromas are just beginning to emerge. Cassis and blackberry jam are joined to smoky, oaky scents. Huge, young and tannic, with high acidity and a treasure chest of buried fruit. Badly in need of at least three years in the cellar."

A metodo classico and undergoing the second fermentation in bottle as opposed to a steel tank like most Proseccos, the bone-dry, savory palate offers ripe pear, Meyer lemon and a hint of bread crust alongside vibrant acidity and a refined, continuous perlage. It shows energy and class."

The wine is rich in blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, and balanced with gorgeous tannins, showing true Napa elegance. Drink now–2012."

Clarendon Hills 2004 Piggott Range Syrah (Clarendon),Clarendon Hills,Red,Piggott Range,,"Clarendon, South Australia, Australia",,,94,Joe Czerwinski,"Boasts a slightly lifted character to the aromas, but also shadings of Asian spice and espresso. This is supple on the palate and dark-fruited, with bold flavors of prune-plum and coffee and a long, firm finish that demands cellaring. Drink 2008–2020."
Björnson 2016 Reserve Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills),Björnson,White,Reserve,Chardonnay,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",12.9%,$35,89,Paul Gregutt,"Made in a lighter style emphasizing elegance and precision, this young wine spent 14 months in 50% new oak. At the moment, oak intensity overrides the pretty apple butter-like fruit flavors, but the overall balance suggests it will iron itself out with more time in bottle."
Winter's Hill 2017 Reserve Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Winter's Hill,Red,Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.1%,$65,91,Paul Gregutt,"This eight-barrel selection handles the challenges of a lighter vintage well, delivering a balanced palate with red currants, raspberries and sweet spice.

Bill Wathan gave the wine full Burgundian treatment, which accounts for the rich creaminess, while the grape itself lends high acidity and a sweet-sour lemon flavor with notes of camphor and tumeric. With the vines dating to 1966, this is an extraordinarily complex, bone-dry wine."
Las Positas 2011 Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),Las Positas,Red,Estate Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Livermore Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.8%,$60,86,Jim Gordon,"This tastes and feels mellow and approachable, with gentle aromas of plums, dried herbs and tomato, and medium body with moderate tannins.

Joseph Faiveley 2006  Bourgogne,Joseph Faiveley,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Bourgogne, Burgundy, France",12.5%,$23,85,Roger Voss,"Light in color, marked by strawberry jam flavors, this is fruity but certainly not weighty.

Fusée 2004 White Zinfandel (California),Fusée,Rose,White,Zinfandel,"California, California Other, California, US",,$6,84,,"Kind of sweet, with simple but pretty flavors of strawberries, vanilla and cinnamon, this clean wine is about as good as white Zin gets."

Château Siran 2013  Margaux,Château Siran,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",13%,$30,86,Roger Voss,This wine has an austere character that comes from the tight structure. There are only hints of possible fruit. It is likely to remain severe even as it matures.

It's classic Dry Creek Zin in a drink-me-now way. Dry, medium-bodied and gentle in tannins, it features lip-smacking flavors of pepper, red currants, tobacco and anise."
Iris Vineyards 2014 Aroha Vineyard Syrah (Umpqua Valley),Iris Vineyards,Red,Aroha Vineyard,,"Umpqua Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",13.3%,$24,88,Paul Gregutt,"Spice, leather, pepper and plum mingle in this medium-weight effort. Purple fruits and intimations of ginger cookie are in play, with pretty baking spices on the finish."
Château Castaing 2018  Côtes de Bourg,Château Castaing,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Côtes de Bourg, Bordeaux, France",14.5%,$15,90,Roger Voss,"Under the same ownership as Château Haut-Guiraud, this estate has produced a wood-aged wine that's rich in dark spicy fruit and ripe tannins. Dense structure shows the wine's potential as well as its concentration. Drink from 2022."
Vaya Vadiso 2012 Chardonnay (Central Valley),Vaya Vadiso,White,,Chardonnay,"Central Valley, Chile",12%,$10,83,Michael Schachner,"Air freshener and tropical aromas lead to a juice-like palate with green tannins. Lime, nettle and nopal flavors finish heavy."
Patland 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),Patland,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.4%,$45,84,,"Barrel aging and contact with lees give this wine a rich creaminess, and there's also plenty of acidity. Hints of unripe grapes lend mint and ammonia notes that dominate citrus flavors."
Rex Hill 2008 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Rex Hill,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,DrizlyVivinoWine.com,90,Paul Gregutt,"Though this is near the bottom end of the Rex Hill Pinot pole, it does not suffer from a lack of flavor. Big fruit, organically grown, runs right through the core, a mix of berries, cherries and plums; woven into the fruit is a lightly leafy vein, a whiff of tobacco, and a suggestion of earthy, organic compost. Thoroughly delicious."
Tarara 2008 Charval White Table Wine White (Virginia),Tarara,White,Charval White Table Wine,White Blend,"Virginia, Virginia, US",12.5%,$20,85,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Apples and pears dominate the nose and palate of this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris. Full bodied and fermented in stainless steel, this slightly off-dry wine is rich in texture, but stays fresh with a vibrant lemon-lime acidity."
Angela Vineyards 2013 Pinot Noir (Yamhill-Carlton),Angela Vineyards,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Yamhill-Carlton, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13%,$48,92,Paul Gregutt,"The label does not bear the name Angela Vineyard, but the fruit is estate grown. This is a tight, focused, young red wine, with tangy raspberry fruit that touches on black cherry. Vivid and penetrating, it needs plenty of time to breathe, and as it does it reveals subtle layers of mocha and caramel. This has the bones to age. Drink now through 2030."
Tommasi 2017 Masseria Surani Arthemis Fiano (Puglia),Tommasi,White,Masseria Surani Arthemis,"Fiano, Italian White","Puglia, Southern Italy, Italy",12.5%,$18,89,Alexander Peartree,"Aromas of ripe pineapple, apricot and dried flowers carry the nose. This medium-bodied white is slick and juicy in feel, with full stone and tropical fruit flavors that are honed by accents of lemon verbena and blanched almond. Despite the lushness, there's good grip and tension to the overall feel."
Les Vignerons du Pallet 2015 Château des Templiers  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),Les Vignerons du Pallet,White,Château des Templiers,"Melon, Other White","Muscadet Sèvre et Maine, Loire Valley, France",12%,$13,85,Roger Voss,This is a crisp and tangy wine. Its citrus fruit and mineral texture give it a bright tight character. It is packed with acidity and with refreshing juicy lime. Drink now.

The wine has acidity and a fresher background giving shape to the ripe fruits. Drink now."
Alleromb 2015 Cuvée B Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Alleromb,Red,Cuvée B,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.6%,$40,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"This is a blend of 53% Merlot, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Malbec. Somewhat lighter in color, the aromas show notes of wet penny, raspberry, wheat, herb stalk, cherry and spice. The flavors are light but juicy, tapering on the finish."
Webster Cellars 2013 Arriere Red (Napa Valley),Webster Cellars,Red,Arriere,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.2%,,92,Virginie Boone,"This blends 60% Merlot with 40% Syrah—a successful marriage that is well structured and modest in ripeness. Cedar, wooded tannin and pencil shavings provide an Old-World character set against a backdrop of juicy tart red fruit and black pepper."
Marqués de Gelida 2009 Brut Reserva Made with Organic Grapes Sparkling (Cava),Marqués de Gelida,Sparkling,Brut Reserva Made with Organic Grapes,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Cava, Catalonia, Spain",11.5%,$19,88,Michael Schachner,"Applesauce, lime and mineral aromas comprise the shy bouquet on this Cava. It feels round yet alive, with crisp apple and peach flavors. Citrus-driven acidity comes out on the finish."
Château la Verrière 2015  Bordeaux Supérieur,Château la Verrière,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux Supérieur, Bordeaux, France",14.5%,$15,88,Roger Voss,"Rich and with good fruit, this is a structured wine that has the density to age well. The dark-chocolate flavors mingle with the black-plum fruits, finishing with just a light lift of acidity."
Palladino 2013 del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba  (Barolo),Palladino,Red,del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$49,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"This wine's new leather, pressed violet and orange zest aromas unfold in the glass. The vibrant, medium-bodied palate offers red berry, baking spice and crushed herb flavors framed by bright acidity and firm, refined tannins."
Tenuta Farneta di Collato 2003 Tenuta Farneta  (Chianti Colli Senesi),Tenuta Farneta di Collato,Red,Tenuta Farneta,Sangiovese,"Chianti Colli Senesi, Tuscany, Italy",12.5%,$8,86,,"A bit reduced, with meaty black-fruit aromas accompanied by hints of grass and hay. The palate is spicy and full of plum and cherry, while the rest of the mouth and finish are carried by short acidity. Hits hard toward the back while scoring points along the way."
Viña Casas Patronales 2010 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),Viña Casas Patronales,Red,Reserva,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Maule Valley, Chile",14%,$11,87,Michael Schachner,"Bashful, mild aromas of herbal berry fruits and mint are followed by a full, round and solid feeling palate. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and blueberry register as fairly ripe and dark, while the finish displays toasty notes, spice flavors and mild heat. This is a step up from good and basic."
Bee Hunter 2017 Filligreen Farms Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),Bee Hunter,White,Filligreen Farms,,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14.8%,$28,90,Jim Gordon,"A light buttery, nutty quality gives this wine a serious, mature edge that is fascinating to taste. Almond, vanilla and a hint of honey dominate very dry fruit flavors."
Kay Brothers 2019 Basket Pressed Amery Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Kay Brothers,Red,Basket Pressed Amery Vineyard,,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$40,91,Christina Pickard,"This bottling from the historic Amery Vineyard opens with notes of fleshy plum, cracked pepper, dried violets and a streak of something more medicinal. In the mouth the powerful tannins are chiseled and chalky, adding textural interest and room in the mix for juicy fruit, with a welcome lift of acidity. Drink now with protein and decanter at hand, or until 2031."
Hood Crest 2017 Grenache (Columbia Gorge (OR)),Hood Crest,Red,,Grenache,"Columbia Gorge (OR), Oregon Other, Oregon, US",14%,$32,84,Sean P. Sullivan,"This is extremely pale in color with an orange tinge at the rim. The aromas offer notes of citrus peel, BBQ smoke, cinnamon and cranberry. Quite smoky flavors follow. The smoke influence is significant."
Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2010 Bernkasteler Badstube Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch),White,Bernkasteler Badstube Spätlese,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",8.5%,$42,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"A note of dried citrus peel adds a touch of spice to the whiff of petrol on this delicate, minerally Riesling. The palate is zippy and brisk, with loads of fresh stone-fruit flavor and a long, steely finish that reverberates."
Camaraderie 2018 LeTendre Vineyard Grenache (Yakima Valley),Camaraderie,Red,LeTendre Vineyard,Grenache,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$28,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"Aromas of white pepper and raspberry lead to plump, full-bodied red fruit flavors. It brings a pleasant tang."
Ökonomierat Rebholz 2007 Von Rotliegenden Spätlese Riesling (Pfalz),Ökonomierat Rebholz,White,Von Rotliegenden Spätlese,Riesling,"Pfalz, Germany",,$45,89,Joe Czerwinski,"This is a somewhat soft and friendly wine, filled with ripe peaches and pears, and with a backbone of lime-like citrus. It even boasts a subtle dose of minerality. Yet it lacks the power and precision of some of the other Rebholz wines, instead settling for being soft and cuddly rather than profound."
Federico Paternina 2008 Clisos Crianza  (Rioja),Federico Paternina,Red,Clisos Crianza,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$14,85,Michael Schachner,"This smells like fresh pavement at first, with gritty black-fruit and burnt leaf notes. The palate feels edgy, with a spotty red-fruit flavor that's matched with notes of resiny oak and vanilla. It finishes in a similar fashion. Novo Imports and Aidil Wines &amp; Liquors."
Weinert 2007 Carrascal Red (Mendoza),Weinert,Red,Carrascal,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,DrizlyVivino,90,Michael Schachner,"Weinert holds its wines back longer than almost any other Argentine winery, hence when you get a blend like this it's mature and ready. This is maderized, with aromas of earth, citrus, tobacco and mushroom. The palate is tight and houses tobacco, mocha, citrus and dried raspberry flavors. If you like aged Rioja, this is for you. The blend is Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot."
Alain Jaume et Fils 2018 Domain Grand Veneur Le Miocène Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),Alain Jaume et Fils,Red,Domain Grand Veneur Le Miocène,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rhône Valley, France",15%,$63,93,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Tangs of granite and firm, gripping tannins lend angularity to concentrated black cherry and plum in this wine. A blend of Grenache (70%), Syrah (20%) and Mourvédre (10%), it's weighty on the palate but sharply cut by zingy red-cassis acidity. At peak now through 2028, the wine should hold further still."
Farnese 2007 Casale Vecchio Pecorino (Terre di Chieti),Farnese,White,Casale Vecchio,"Pecorino, Italian White","Terre di Chieti, Central Italy, Italy",13%,$19,87,,This fresh and buoyant Pecorino from Central Italy delivers immediate and simple aromas of stone fruit with some papaya and pineapple. It tastes crisp and vibrant and has the natural structure to pair with ham or cold cuts.
Pichler-Krutzler 2016 Ried Loibenberg Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),Pichler-Krutzler,White,Ried Loibenberg,Grüner Veltliner,"Wachau, Austria",13.5%,$48,95,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Green pear and lemon zest characterize the nose of this concentrated, salty wine. Zesty citrus notes give both texture and direction on the taut palate, which shimmers with savory, yeasty, miso-like saltiness. A very delicious, impactful little package that is sure to unfold beautifully. Drink 2020–2030."
Thörle 2016 Trocken Grauburgunder (Rheinhessen),Thörle,White,Trocken,,"Rheinhessen, Germany",12.5%,$22,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Fresh citrus and pear flavors are highlighted by racy streaks of lime and tart pineapple in this unusually zippy Grauburgunder, or Pinot Gris. It's light in body yet creamy in texture, with a long, lingering finish marked by crushed stones and salty minerality."
Lionel Osmin & Cie 2018 La Dune Domaine de Bachen Rosé (Landes),Lionel Osmin & Cie,Rose,La Dune Domaine de Bachen,Rosé,"Landes, Southwest France, France",12.5%,$17,87,Roger Voss,"From vineyards in the forested region towards the Atlantic coast, this fresh and red-fruit-flavored blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc is bright and lively. A touch of caramel from the Merlot in the blend doesn't detract from the fresh aftertaste. Drink now."
Tiziano Mazzoni 2010 Ai Livelli  (Ghemme),Tiziano Mazzoni,Red,Ai Livelli,Nebbiolo,"Ghemme, Piedmont, Italy",13.5%,$52,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"This is still young and closed, but pretty aromas of rose, perfumed berry, baking spice and menthol eventually emerge. The palate delivers crunchy red cherry, raspberry, white pepper, anise and a balsamic note alongside austere but fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Give it time to open up and develop complexity. Drink 2018–2028."
Iron Horse 2013 Wedding Cuvée Sparkling (Green Valley),Iron Horse,Sparkling,Wedding Cuvée,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Green Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$44,94,Virginie Boone,"Exuberant in mousse, this wine is luxurious and rich, the perfect quaff for any occasion. Made from 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay, and aged for three years, it's bright in bolts of green apple and strawberry."
Mahana 2016 Carbonique Pinot Noir Upper Moutere Hills Rosé (Nelson),Mahana,Rose,Carbonique Pinot Noir Upper Moutere Hills,Rosé,"Nelson, New Zealand",14%,$42,84,Christina Pickard,"As the name suggests, this is fermented using carbonic fermentation. While it should be applauded for trying something new, the experiment, in this case, doesn't really work. Reductive and stinky at first, this eventually blows off to reveal ripe melon and red fruit notes, with florals and (thanks to the carbonic) a distinctly bubble gum quality. The palate, at 14% alcohol, is on the hot side, with a medium to full body and a heaviness of fruit that lacks brightness and freshness."
Castello Banfi 2004 San Angelo Pinot Grigio (Toscana),Castello Banfi,White,San Angelo,Pinot Grigio,"Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",12.5%,$18,84,,"Floral and a bit different, with a meaty, almost spicy character. Flavors of pear and citrus are modest, while the balance is good and the body light to medium in weight. Fresh and easy; borders on stylish."
Quinta do Vallado 2012 Vallado Red (Douro),Quinta do Vallado,Red,Vallado,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",13.5%,$23,89,Roger Voss,"This is the entry-level wine at Vallado, one of the Douro's top quintas. Full of berry fruits, it also has layers of tannins and acidity, but is rich and soft enough now not to need much aging. Although it could be drunk now, it will be better from 2016."
Foley 2014 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Foley,Red,Barrel Select,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$60,92,Matt Kettmann,"This well-balanced Pinot Noir shows red-cherry fruit, with complex hints of anise, star anise, thyme and even tarragon on the nose. Both the acidity and tannic structure are lively but not aggressive, carrying tart cherry flavors deep into the finish."
Château Darzac 2006 Réserve  (Bordeaux),Château Darzac,Red,Réserve,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",13%,$15,83,Roger Voss,"Lean, initially bitter, this is a firmly tannic wine. The berry fruits show freshness, but the dry tannins dominate. Of course, it's young, but the texture is too light for much development."
Alta Cima 2007 Reserve Merlot (Lontué Valley),Alta Cima,Red,Reserve,Merlot,"Lontué Valley, Chile",13.5%,$13,80,Michael Schachner,"Acceptable aromas but all acid in the mouth. A sour, bitter, red fruit dominant wine with very little going for it. Offers nothing but sourness on the palate and finish."
Obelisco Estate 2010 Estate Grown Merlot (Red Mountain),Obelisco Estate,Red,Estate Grown,Merlot,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.9%,$45,91,Paul Gregutt,"This soft, supple and seductive Merlot (with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend) is both earthy and sensuous. The mouthfeel is like smooth felt. Black cherry, blackberry and a dash of cola fill the mouth, with lush tannins and a long finish. There's just a hint of brown sugar as it wraps up."
Pleil 2013 Klassik Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),Pleil,White,Klassik,Grüner Veltliner,"Weinviertel, Austria",12.5%,,86,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Spritzy freshness, lemony hints and a slender body combine to make an uncomplicated but rewarding summer wine."
Tenute Niccolai 2009 Bellarina  (Brunello di Montalcino),Tenute Niccolai,Red,Bellarina,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",15%,,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"This wine starts with aromas of toasted oak, coffee, mature blackberries and hints of bell pepper. The palate offers overripe plum, black currants, toasted oak, chocolate, and espresso alongside astringent and drying wood tannins that give this an abrupt finish."
The Joy Fantastic 2018 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),The Joy Fantastic,White,,Chardonnay,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$50,94,Matt Kettmann,"This is a fascinating bottling that holds interest for repeat sips and is likely to age very well. Yuzu-peel, underripe apricot, honeysuckle and light toast aromas frame the nose. The palate zings with racy sharp laser-focused acidity, delivering flavors of bright grapefruit, crisp melon rind and tart apples."
Stift Göttweig 2016 Furth Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),Stift Göttweig,White,Furth,Grüner Veltliner,"Kremstal, Austria",12.5%,$23,91,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Green apple, peardrop and Conference pear shine on the nose of this wine. The streamlined palate clebrates those fresh flavors, highlighting them with extra lemon spritz, a salty, yeasty fringe adding complexity. The finish is lip-smacking, moreish and dry."
Peirano 2012 The Heritage Collection Tempranillo (Lodi),Peirano,Red,The Heritage Collection,Tempranillo,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",13.8%,$14,86,Jim Gordon,"The smoky, peppery aromas and smoky, pomegranate flavors may be atypical, but the wine is well-balanced and enjoyable to drink."
Herdade das Servas 2013 Monte das Servas Escolha Red (Alentejano),Herdade das Servas,Red,Monte das Servas Escolha,Portuguese Red,"Alentejano, Portugal",14.5%,$15,87,Roger Voss,"This big, bold wine blends local grapes with Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional. It has red fruits and rounded tannins that are well integrated with the fruitiness. Full in the mouth and with delicious acidity, it is ready to drink."
Podere Paganico 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),Podere Paganico,Red,Riserva,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$64,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Mature black-skinned fruit, new leather, Mediterranean herb and dark spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this big, bold red. The brawny monolithic palate doles out ripe plum, black cherry marinated in spirits and cake spice alongside chewy tannins and the warmth of evident alcohol. Drink 2018–2025."
Château Cambon la Pelousse 2016 Barrel Sample  (Haut-Médoc),Château Cambon la Pelousse,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Haut-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",,,91,Roger Voss,"90–92. Barrel Sample. This is a delicious, juicy wine, with black fruit tones backed by firm tannins. The structure and the concentration don't take away from the exuberant fruits."
Rios de Chile 2011 Limited Edition Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),Rios de Chile,White,Limited Edition,Sauvignon Blanc,"Casablanca Valley, Chile",13%,$17,87,Michael Schachner,"The nose on this wine is fresh but nothing unusual or exciting. In the mouth, it's racy, with acidity and flavors of green veggies, citrus fruits and pith. Things turn more pithy and mildly bitter on the finish, where tarragon and rosemary accents take over."
Concannon 2017 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),Concannon,White,Reserve,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",13.9%,$28,90,Virginie Boone,"This is a successful, small-production white that's bright, textured and memorable in swathes of well-heeled grapefruit and Meyer lemon. A grassy undertone of pea shoots plays well against the crisp fruit."
Rodney Strong 1999 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Rodney Strong,Red,Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$30,90,,"Wears a toasty mantle of smoke, meat and burnt marshmallow. Yet we found the dark cherry and tart plum fruit core to be strong enough to weather its oak. The wine's polished rusticity has great appeal, with earthy, dusty tannins, pepper and cola accents. Drink now through 2007. Editors' Choice."
Hendry 2005 Pinot Gris (Napa Valley),Hendry,White,,,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$19,85,,"Entirely made in stainless steel, this is a fresh tasting, vibrant young wine. It has zingy acids, and forward flavors of citrus fruits, melons and white pepper. This dry wine is nice as an apéritif."
Villa Maria 1999 Private Bin Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Hawke's Bay),Villa Maria,Red,Private Bin,"Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Hawke's Bay, New Zealand",12.5%,$13,85,Michael Schachner,"Spice notes play heavily on the brambly, herbal nose.  This a full-bodied, chunky mix of 53% Cabernet, 24% Merlot, 13% Pinotage and 10% Syrah.  No grape type in particular sticks out on the palate, which is heavy with oregano and basil notes in addition to red-plum fruit.  Best for casual drinking; anything left will help out a red sauce."
Domaine Albin Jacumin 2018 La Bégude des Papes White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),Domaine Albin Jacumin,White,La Bégude des Papes,Rhône-style White Blend,"Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rhône Valley, France",13.5%,,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Earthen notes of smoke and crushed minerals linger from nose to palate in this juicy, moderately full-bodied white. A blend of 60% Grenache Blanc, 30% Clairette and 10% Bourboulenc vinified and aged in 20% new French oak, it puts a spotlight on pristine tangerine and grapefruit flavors edged by a touch of bitter nut skin. Ready to drink now but should maintain through 2028."
Chanson Père et Fils 2009 Les Vergelesses Premier Cru  (Pernand-Vergelesses),Chanson Père et Fils,Red,Les Vergelesses Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Pernand-Vergelesses, Burgundy, France",,$50,92,Roger Voss,"This has ripe red fruits and soft, integrated tannins, with concentration and a voluptuous exterior. This will be ready to drink soon."
Domaine la Goujonne 2019 Gamali Rosé (Côtes de Provence),Domaine la Goujonne,Rose,Gamali,Rosé,"Côtes de Provence, Provence, France",13.5%,$20,90,Roger Voss,"This rich wine is smoothly textured, full of fruit balanced with acidity. Its blend that includes Mourvèdre gives the wine texture as well as concentration. This rosé ready to drink from late 2020."
Elvio Cogno 1999 Ravera  (Barolo),Elvio Cogno,Red,Ravera,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,VivinoGary's Wine,91,,"In need of bottle aging, Cogno's '99 Ravera blends molasses with dates and figs to give the impression of a spiced fruitcake impregnated with tannins instead of rum. Give it until 2010, when it should begin to open up."
Poggio al Tesoro 2015 Solosole Vermentino (Toscana),Poggio al Tesoro,White,Solosole,"Vermentino, Italian White","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$23,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with aromas of white and yellow wild flower and yellow stone fruit. The bright palate doles out juicy yellow peach, nectarine and a hint of Mediterranean herb alongside fresh acidity."
Roederer Estate NV Brut Rosé  (Anderson Valley),Roederer Estate,Sparkling,Brut Rosé,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",,VivinoGary's Wine,89,,"It's complex and inviting, with bread dough, rasberry and vanilla, and atouch of smoky honey.  The flavors are similar, with white peaches making an appearance.  Medium-weight with a slightly creamy mouthful, it closes with creamy-toast flavors on the long finish.  This sparkling wine will have wide appeal: It's big, open and enjoyable."
Pashey 2017 Ribbon Ridge Estate Extra Brut Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Ribbon Ridge),Pashey,Sparkling,Ribbon Ridge Estate Extra Brut Blanc de Blancs,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",12.7%,$65,93,Paul Gregutt,"The fourth vintage of this 100% Chardonnay, méthode Champenoise sparkler opens with a whiff of toast and fresh flavors of lemon pith, apple, white peach and pineapple. The clarity and rather suppressed power are apparent despite its being very recently disgorged. Tuck it away and drink after 2024."
Poggio Antico 2008  Brunello di Montalcino,Poggio Antico,Red,,"Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese","Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",,VivinoGary's Wine,90,,"Poggio Antico is one of the best estates in Montalcino but the 2008 vintage doesn't reach the impressive heights of 2006 or 2007 that showed much fuller and more generous results. This edition offers plum, wild berry and leather aromas with a lean mouthfeel and sharp acidity that will soften with a few more years of bottle aging."
Babcock 2018 Born Ready Peake Vineyard Grenache (Sta. Rita Hills),Babcock,Red,Born Ready Peake Vineyard,Grenache,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$60,91,Matt Kettmann,Dark boysenberry and toasty oak aromas lead into hints of caramel on the nose of this riper expression. Candied flavors of violet and dark-purple fruit are wrapped in rustic tannins on the palate.
Jeff HIll 2012 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Jeff HIll,White,,Chardonnay,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.6%,$50,93,,"Utterly dry and crisp, the wine carries a flinty minerality and lime, peach and green-apple flavors. It was largely barrel-fermented, but the oak never feels heavy or tastes sweet. Instead, it provides a subtle perfume throughout. Don't drink this wine too cold, or you'll miss the nuances."
Stinson 2012 Rosé (Monticello),Stinson,Rose,,Rosé,"Monticello, Virginia, US",13%,$17,84,,"A rosé of 100% Mourvèdre, this bears mild flavors of red cherry, candied strawberry and tropical fruit, which are enlivened by fresh acidity. It's a simple rosé that would be an enjoyable accompaniment to a picnic lunch."
Cave de Tain 2017 Première Note Rosé de Syrah (Collines Rhôdaniennes),Cave de Tain,Rose,Première Note Rosé de,,"Collines Rhôdaniennes, Rhône Valley, France",12%,$16,86,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While the nose of this light-bodied rosé is quite peachy and perfumed, the palate is demure, suggesting mild pear and underripe apricot. Dry and full bodied, it's balanced by fresh acidity and a salty, mineral finish. Drink now."
Summerland 2017 Chardonnay (Central Coast),Summerland,White,,Chardonnay,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$15,87,Matt Kettmann,"Singed lemon and baked apple converge for a very perfumed aromatic entry to this bottling. The palate is very familiar with flavors of toast, lemon and apple, with an acidity that cuts through the sip."
Spanish Vines 2008 Sauvignon Blanc-Macabeo White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),Spanish Vines,White,Sauvignon Blanc-Macabeo,White Blend,"Vino de la Tierra de Castilla, Central Spain, Spain",12%,$10,83,Michael Schachner,"Same score as the prior year, and pretty much the same wine. It's dusty and slightly burnt in aromas and flavors, with banana, peach and pithy bitterness extending onto the finish. Mouthfeel is the best part; otherwise it struggles to make the cut."
Finca El Origen 2012 Reserva Chardonnay (Mendoza),Finca El Origen,White,Reserva,Chardonnay,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$11,85,Michael Schachner,"For a basic Chardonnay, this fits the bill. Citrus and peach aromas are standard and clean. The palate is tight and juicy, with no overt oak feel. Flavors of melon and pear have light spice and vanilla accents, while the finish is crisp."
Renwood 2000 Viognier (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),Renwood,White,,Viognier,"Shenandoah Valley (CA), Sierra Foothills, California, US",13.5%,$25,90,,"Enticing, with velvety texture but firmness, nonetheless, on the palate. A sleek and subtle blend of apricot, peach, spice, herb and citrus flavors, all couched elegantly with finesse."
Burnt Bridge 2013 Pont Brûlé Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Burnt Bridge,Red,Pont Brûlé,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",15.5%,$35,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"Grenache (38%) takes the lead followed by Mourvèdre (34%) and Syrah, with the fruit coming from Seven Hills and Les Collines vineyards. Blueberry pie, herb and spice aromas are followed by extracted blue and black-fruit flavors that bring some warmth along with them."
Tenuta Argentiera 2009 Poggio ai Ginepri  (Bolgheri),Tenuta Argentiera,Red,Poggio ai Ginepri,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Bolgheri, Tuscany, Italy",,,89,,"Soft and rich, with loads of ripe fruit flavors, this Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah--Merlot blend offers a crisp dash of freshness that keeps the palate clean.

But it has a faux-sugar note on the finish (think Nutrasweet) that made me like it less than I wanted to.
Castelvecchi 2014 Lodolaio Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Castelvecchi,Red,Lodolaio Riserva,Sangiovese,"Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$32,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"This offers aromas reminiscent of cedar, black-skinned fruit and a subtle whiff of oak.

The depth is impeccable and the balance and pop are commendable. All hail Argentina, or at least Barons de Rothschild and Nicolas Catena for coming up with this affordable blend of Malbec and Cabernet that pulses with berry fruit, waves of chocolate and so much toasty persistence that it almost requires brakes. For under $20 this is faultless stuff. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports."
Château Phélan-Ségur 2017 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Estèphe),Château Phélan-Ségur,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Estèphe, Bordeaux, France",,,93,Roger Voss,"92–94. Barrel Sample. The oak is currently quite forward and powerful in this young wine, which needs time for the fruit to come through. But the fruit is there, with black currant acidity and freshness showing in the background. Let the wine soften and don't drink before 2024."
Wrath 2019 Ex Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),Wrath,White,Ex,Sauvignon Blanc,"Monterey, Central Coast, California, US",13.2%,$19,91,Matt Kettmann,"There's something rugged and rough about this wine that makes it so compelling. Aromas of beach sand and drying kelp recall the seashore, yet there's Anaheim chili, too. The palate combines that seaweed with jalapeño, making for a visceral, slightly funky experience."

Lynmar 2004 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Lynmar,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$36,89,,"Lynmar's basic Russian River is lighter than its more expensive designation bottlings, but it's right up there, which makes it a relative value.

The palate is a high-wire act of bright red fruit combined with thick milk chocolate and malt. The tannins and acidity allow the wine to be aggressive, maybe too much so given that the fruit is somewhat tart and prickly."
Wines & Winemakers 2014 Andreza Touriga Nacional-Touriga Franca Red (Douro),Wines & Winemakers,Red,Andreza Touriga Nacional-Touriga Franca,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",13.5%,$18,88,Roger Voss,"Ripe and bold, this is a rich wine whose dense fruit is balanced by its equally dense tannins.

Hillinger 2010 Pinot Blanc (Leithaberg),Hillinger,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Leithaberg, Austria",12.5%,,87,Roger Voss,"There can be few Pinot Blancs that come in such a heavy bottle.

Domaine Leflaive 2007  Macon-Verge,Domaine Leflaive,White,,Chardonnay,"Macon-Verge, Burgundy, France",,$36,88,Roger Voss,"Caramel wood aromas, with smooth fruit. The wine is rich, warm, with the pure white and yellow fruit flavors showing well. It is crisp, but also rich."

Joseph Phelps 1997 Le Mistral Red (California),Joseph Phelps,Red,Le Mistral,Rhône-style Red Blend,"California, California Other, California, US",,$25,91,Michael Schachner,"A blend of six Rhône grapes. It's lush and plush. A lot of sun-baked black fruit here and virtually no edge to speak of. In fact, it's almost too friendly. Aromas of graham crackers and a clear flavor of chocolate make for an interesting drink."
Williams Selyem 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),Williams Selyem,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",13.6%,$37,91,,"A gorgeous Pinot Noir for drinking over the next few years.

Domaine Charles Frey 2016 Harmonie Pinot Noir (Alsace),Domaine Charles Frey,Red,Harmonie,Pinot Noir,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A lick of vanilla precedes red berries on the nose. On the palate, the berries are expressed as red currant and lovely tart cranberry. This is fresh and light, easy and totally fruit-driven. It would work well as a chilled red with its refreshing backbone and light body."

Ca' Del Grevino 2014 Estate Vineyards White Riesling (Santa Maria Valley),Ca' Del Grevino,White,Estate Vineyards White,Riesling,"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.13%,$60,91,Matt Kettmann,"There's a classic touch of petrol on the nose of this bottling, as well as richer notes of candied lemon, marmalade, preserved lime and dried citrus. On the palate, it's oily and viscous, but honey, lemon syrup and tangerine zest flavors lighten it considerably. A great all-around experience."
Livio Felluga 2001 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Venezia Giulia),Livio Felluga,White,,Pinot Grigio,"Friuli Venezia Giulia, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13%,$24,90,Joe Czerwinski,"There's a slight coppery tinge to this wine's color, which sets it apart from the vast majority of other Grigios on the market. And maybe it's just the suggestion of the hue, but it seems to taste ""pink"" as well, showcasing ripe berries and appples backed by tangy acids and great length. Classy stuff."
Forget-Brimont 2010 Vintage Brut Premier Cru  (Champagne),Forget-Brimont,Sparkling,Vintage Brut Premier Cru,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$95,93,Roger Voss,"Bottled after 10 years on its lees, this Champagne has great richness, with mature flavors mingling with the acidity and kiwi fruit flavors.

Acidity streamlines the generous, full-fruited body while soft mousse amplifies all the rich, layered apple flavors. The midpalate texture and finish are impressive. This is the full, delicious package and will make a classy apéritif with enough character to accompany delicate, fine cuisine. The length speaks for itself: pure class. Zero dosage."
Barton & Guestier 2018 Bistro Rue La Fayette Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Barton & Guestier,Red,Bistro Rue La Fayette,Pinot Noir,"Vin de France, France Other, France",12%,$15,86,Fiona Adams,"Blackberry and plum aromas are balanced by anise and black pepper on the nose.

Domaine Terlato & Chapoutier 2006 lieu dit Malakoff Shiraz (Pyrenees),Domaine Terlato & Chapoutier,Red,lieu dit Malakoff,,"Pyrenees, Victoria, Australia",14.5%,$40,90,Joe Czerwinski,"Seems more elegant than the brawny 2005, with pretty aromas of violets and cracked pepper that glide easily into flavors of mixed berries and vanilla. It's lighter in weight than many Australian Shiraz, fresher and higher in acidity, which gives it a bit of Old World sensibility. Drink now–2016."
Muga 2006 Rosé (Rioja),Muga,Rose,,Rosé,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$11,88,Michael Schachner,"Despite some tempered oak aging, this one will whet your whistle and then some. Talk about cutting acidity and being fit and trim; it's like a hard-bodied personal trainer. It doesn't have an ounce of fat on it, so the aromas are tight and minerally and the flavors lean and crisp. Will plow through grilled vegetables and chicken or tuna salad with ease. Made primarily from Garnacha, with some Viura and Tempranillo."
Hugel 2005 Jubilee Hugel Riesling (Alsace),Hugel,White,Jubilee Hugel,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12%,$60,87,,"Starts off with fairly soft aromas of honeydew, petrol and steely minerality.

Château Bouscaut 2006 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),Château Bouscaut,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,,88,Roger Voss,"87—89 Barrel sample.

This is simply wonderful, offering a wealth of red fruit, cola, spice, mineral and earth flavors. The tannins are negotiable, the acidity brisk and clean, the finish dry and long. You may even want to cellar it for 5–6 years, although it's fully enjoyable now."
River's Edge 2015 Elkton Cuvée Pinot Noir (Elkton Oregon),River's Edge,Red,Elkton Cuvée,Pinot Noir,"Elkton Oregon, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",15%,$20,90,Paul Gregutt,"This is a delicious and beautifully-proportioned wine that delivers exceptional value. Concentrated cranberry and blueberry fruit takes the middle ground, and the raw-wood aromas suggest that further bottle age will soften the flavors on the finish."

Château Desmirail 2016 Barrel Sample  (Margaux),Château Desmirail,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",,,89,Roger Voss,"88–90. Barrel Sample. This is a producer that needs to watch its wood. This is hugely toasty, and the oak suppresses the fruit."
Protopapas 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Greece),Protopapas,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Greece, Greece",13.5%,$17,82,Susan Kostrzewa,"This wine starts with a spicy nose of tobacco and mocha tinged with a green character.

A plump, grabby palate deals minty green berry flavors and plenty of oak, while this never sheds its oaky, highly herbal identity. Vintage 2016 saw a lot of rain and this Malbec shows it."
General's Ridge 2011 Pinot Grigio (Virginia),General's Ridge,White,,Pinot Grigio,"Virginia, Virginia, US",12.5%,,84,,"Sulfur shrouds this wine at first, but it dissipates with time to reveal mild notes of honeyed nut, kiwi, white flower and golden apple. The palate has balanced acidity and a slight oiliness, and the flavors seem a bit muted at the moment."

The flavors are rich and exuberant in smoky red cherries, raspberries and cola. The softness suggests against extended cellaring, but why wouldn't you want this silky, complex wine now?"
Joseph Jewell 2015 Ryan Vineyard Pinot Noir (Humboldt County),Joseph Jewell,Red,Ryan Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Humboldt County, North Coast, California, US",13.5%,$39,95,Jim Gordon,"This extraordinary wine sets a high standard for California's Humboldt County. An intriguing tension between ripeness and tartness gives this wine great balance, while red and black cherries, rhubarb and subtle oak spices provide plenty of complexity. The wine is medium bodied, has firm tannins to stiffen the mouthfeel just enough and is quite concentrated without being heavy."
Alphonse Mellot 2016 La Demoiselle  (Sancerre),Alphonse Mellot,White,La Demoiselle,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sancerre, Loire Valley, France",13%,$57,94,Roger Voss,"A single-vineyard wine from one of the highest points in Sancerre, this is concentrated and dense, full of taut fruit and rich acidity.

Imported by Vin Divino."
Desert Wind 2004 Merlot (Wahluke Slope),Desert Wind,Red,,Merlot,"Wahluke Slope, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$15,80,Paul Gregutt,"Stemmy, green and harsh, with flavors of earth, stem and pip. The watery, dilute flavors barely suggest fruit."

Rhubarb, cranberry and wild strawberry attempt to intrude, and do quietly, but it's the cardamom and white pepper that persist most emphatically."
Pine Ridge 2009 Fortis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Pine Ridge,Red,Fortis,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$150,87,,"This is a blend of the winery's vineyard sources in Rutherford and Stags Leap. It's very delicious and complex in blackberry and blueberry jam, cola, mocha and smoky oak flavors, but is surprisingly soft. It's almost as if the tannins and acids were taken out. Drink up."

Waxed apple, peach and lime aromas kick things off. There's a fringe of salt, like the rim of a margarita glass. Laser-like acidity slices through the highly textural palate, leading once again to a long, salty finish. Drink now–2028."

It's zippy in acidity and ripe in briary raspberry and cherry fruit, with spicy, smoky oak complexity. Really defines the luxurious silkiness of the appellation. The grapes are mostly from the Fiddlestix Vineyard, with the balance hailing from Rio Vista Vineyard. Drink now-2015."
Undurraga 2009 T.H. Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),Undurraga,Red,T.H.,Pinot Noir,"Leyda Valley, Chile",13.5%,$25,85,Michael Schachner,"The first Pinot in Undurraga's Terroir Hunter series is lean, tart and zesty, but also clean and pleasing in its own right.

It's a complex, layered sparkler with creamy vanilla mousse and golden saturation."
Castle Rock 2003 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),Castle Rock,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",,$11,82,,A weird and disturbing aroma suggesting a chemical flaw ruins this wine's otherwise decent flavors and texture.

Pig & Poke 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),Pig & Poke,Red,,Merlot,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.1%,$16,88,,"Lots of bang for your buck with this rich, full-bodied young Merlot.

Domaine Ostertag 2015 Fronholz Pinot Noir (Alsace),Domaine Ostertag,Red,Fronholz,Pinot Noir,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$59,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A gentle lift of crushed black cherry rises from the glass.

Accents of spice and mint add complexity. The wine will benefit from 2–3 years of aging to soften and round out, but it's drinkable now."
Château la Varière 2009 La Grande Chevalerie Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou Villages Brissac),Château la Varière,Red,La Grande Chevalerie,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Anjou Villages Brissac, Loire Valley, France",12.5%,$45,91,Roger Voss,"It is rare to find pure Cabernet Sauvignon in the Loire, but 2009 was the year when it worked with ripe black currant and berry fruits.

Viñedos de Canata 2004 Chardonnay (Bío Bío Valley),Viñedos de Canata,White,,Chardonnay,"Bío Bío Valley, Chile",13%,$9,84,Michael Schachner,"A touch waxy and oily, with flower blossom and butterscotch scents but no overt, identifiable fruit. Lively and acidic, a trait of the chilly, emerging southern Bío Bío area. Finishes spry but short on flavor. Imported by Corkscrew Imports."

Ledger David 2010 Orion's Nebula Red (Rogue Valley),Ledger David,Red,Orion's Nebula,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Rogue Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",14.3%,$30,85,Paul Gregutt,"A blend of Cab Franc, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Syrah, this was aged for 18 months in 30% new American oak. Perhaps the barrel aging accounts for the over-riding vanilla flavor. That, and some herbal highlights, seem to mask the fruit."
St. Pauls 2012 Passion Sauvignon (Alto Adige),St. Pauls,White,Passion,"Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc","Alto Adige, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13.5%,$29,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Here's a round Sauvignon with subdued aromas of ripe tropical fruit, peach and cut grass.

Verité 2008 La Joie Red (Sonoma County),Verité,Red,La Joie,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",14%,$450,94,,"Right now this is not typically soft and lush like a cult Cab, but hard in tannins, with minerality like little particles of granite. Buried deep down is a pirate's treasure of ripe, intense blackberry fruit. New oak, to the tune of 94%, doesn't cloud the wine, suggesting this blend's its intensity and concentration. The wine is comprised of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, sourced throughout Sonoma County. Clearly this is one for the cellar; drink after 2018."
Finca Antigua 2006 Petit Verdot (La Mancha),Finca Antigua,Red,,Petit Verdot,"La Mancha, Central Spain, Spain",14%,$15,87,Michael Schachner,"Runs up and down the hill with firmness, acidity and zest. There's clear cherry on the nose and some Zin-like flavor that tells you it's something different (Petit Verdot). Not weak but sort of limited in content. There's also holding potential based on how it quickly improves with airing. A treat for everyday meats, stews, pastas and grills."

The nose is dense and earthy but quickly opens with time in glass to reveal bushels of dried herbs, spices, cherries and flowers. Silky, brambly fruit is wound by firm, textured tannins on the medium-bodied palate. It's a charming, restrained wine that balances New World sunshine with Old World charm."

Iijima,"Pristine but intensely ripe blueberry and cassis are shaded by granite and menthol. It's a luscious, sultry Syrah balanced by brisk acidity that penetrates long on the palate. Fine, chalky tannins make it ready to enjoy now, but it should drink well through 2027."
Cave de Tain 2007 Esprit de Granit  (Saint-Joseph),Cave de Tain,Red,Esprit de Granit,,"Saint-Joseph, Rhône Valley, France",13%,$29,88,,"Deep, dense, purple color. Pronounced aromas of toasty vanilla, clove, sweet spice dominate the backdrop of ultra-ripe black fruit. Modern, forward style with lots of vanilla cream, coffee and spicy blackberry pie flavors.

The palate then displays juicy roundness in the form of ripe, yellow pear pervading chalky depth. Rich lemon-peel notes create contour and add mouthwatering brightness to this concentrated, understated wine that comes with subdued but distinct power. Drink 2025–2045."

This Sélection shows both rich black fruit and solid tannins that are typical. Over the next six months, it's likely the fruitiness will become more dominant."
Gloria Ferrer NV Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Carneros),Gloria Ferrer,Sparkling,Blanc de Blancs,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",12.5%,DrizlyVivinoGary's Wine,87,,"Based on Chardonnay, this sparking wine is dry, crisp and yeasty, with orange, mango and lime flavors and a dry finish. The main criticism is that the bubbles are scoury and fierce, lacking the finesse of a fine sparkling wine."
Silver Buckle 2011 Chardonnay (Lodi),Silver Buckle,White,,Chardonnay,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",13.5%,$18,86,Virginie Boone,"A full-bodied yet crisp Chardonnay, balanced with just a tiny hint of lingering ripeness. Fine for mid-week meals."

The palate, right now, is open and bold. Ripe Mirabelle fruit almost bounces with juiciness, framed by more of that zesty tangerine peel. The palate is concentrated and energetic, generous but racy and certainly brimming with fruity, vivid freshness. Drink 2025–2045."

The tannins are tough and astringent, but when they melt away over the next decade or so, they'll leave behind sweet currants, cedar and violets."

Sullivan,"This wine is a blend of fruit from Oasis, Gamache and Olsen vineyards and was aged half in stainless steel with the rest in neutral barrels. It's a bit reduced out of the gate, opening up to reveal kiwi, citrus, pineapple and herb aromas. The bountiful tropical fruit flavors delight."

Erupts in the most complex blackberries, black currants, licorice and 100% new smoky oak flavors, with a spicy finish that goes on and on. The tannins are strong and fine and impressive. Not for the faint-hearted, and not a wine to drink now, as it will swamp food. Should begin to emerge after 2012."
Château Vitallis 2018  Mâcon-Fuissé,Château Vitallis,White,,Chardonnay,"Mâcon-Fuissé, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$18,87,Roger Voss,"Apple flavors and a light texture give this wine an open character. Acidity, bright fruitiness and zesty orange peel enhance the wine's freshness. It is ready to drink."

Stephenson Cellars 2004 Syrah (Washington),Stephenson Cellars,Red,,,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$32,88,Paul Gregutt,"Tight and dense, this is a full-flavored, smoky and rich version of Syrah, with flavors that seem a bit cooked. The fruit is smooth, mature and showing a mix of berry, currant and plum flavors. Forward and softer than the reserve, it's a wine for near-term drinking."
Eponymous 2010 Syrah (Napa Valley),Eponymous,Red,,,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.4%,$46,87,,"So ripe and sweet in raspberry jam, cherry pie and plum sauce flavor, it makes it hard to appreciate the other qualities of this Syrah.

There's a juicy part to the wine, but only after digging through a layer of dill-scented wood. Tannic, full-bodied and lengthy, it needs three years at least to show its true self. Now it's just an oaked-up baby."

Allram 2017 Ried Gaisberg Riesling (Kamptal),Allram,White,Ried Gaisberg,Riesling,"Kamptal, Austria",13%,$30,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"An aromatic tinge of yarrow and crushed citrus leaf adds heady allure to the lemony flavors on the nose. The palate, still slightly spritzy, presents a riper note, a rounder aspect despite all its lemon freshness. There is something gentle, mild, juicy and harmonious about this.

This wine changes constantly in the glass and should improve with age through 2005."
Moorooduc 2017 Estate Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula),Moorooduc,Red,Estate,Pinot Noir,"Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, Australia",13%,$38,93,Christina Pickard,"Still young despite some bottle age, this elegant Pinot takes time to open. When it does, it presents an array of attractive notes, from plump, brambly red berries and dried roses to mushrooms and hoisin sauce. A backbone of vanillin oak is present but well placed. Medium bodied, it's broad in shape but tucked in neatly by warm, spicy tannins. With lovely length and texture, this is a classy wine with flesh on its bones. It could be drunk now with decanter or cellared until 2031."

Maysara 2007 Pinot Blanc (McMinnville),Maysara,White,,Pinot Blanc,"McMinnville, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$17,89,Paul Gregutt,"Pinot Blanc may be the most underrated grape in Oregon; it straddles the line between Pinot Gris and Chardonnay—at least the good ones do. This is a good one. It's full, loaded with pear-flavored fruit, ripe and round yet retaining its acids and focus. Spicy highlights creep into the finish, and there are even some noticeable tannins, a bit unusual in a white wine, that add definition to the expansive finish."
Penfolds 1996 Magill Estate Shiraz (South Australia),Penfolds,Red,Magill Estate,,"South Australia, South Australia, Australia",,$47,91,,"Explosive aromas of roasted coffee, cocoa, pepper, blackberry and smoke.

But its robustness and concentration—with notes of plump plum, cassis, mint, ground pepper and chocolaty oak—is neatly balanced by beautifully textured tannins. Well-balanced with surprising finesse for its price point, it never veers into syrupy or cooked territory. Drink now–2028."

Socré 2014 Roncaglie  (Barbaresco),Socré,Red,Roncaglie,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$55,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Pipe-tobacco, blue-flower and menthol aromas escape the glass along with an earthy hint of cured meats. It's linearly structured and racy, offering crushed raspberry, strawberry compote and licorice along with an earthy hint of game on the salty finish. Fine-grained tannins provide support."
Champagne Prié NV Coeur d'Ebène  (Champagne),Champagne Prié,Sparkling,Coeur d'Ebène,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$90,93,Roger Voss,"Disgorged in November 2018, this intense wine has now had plenty of time to develop some maturity. Richness as well as a touch of toast come through the tight texture and citrus fruits. It is ready to drink."
Galleano NV Mary Margaret Sherry (Cucamonga Valley),Galleano,Dessert,Mary Margaret,Sherry,"Cucamonga Valley, South Coast, California, US",18%,$41,91,Matt Kettmann,"There's a chocolate side to the brandy- like prune aromas on the nose of this Sherry-style dessert wine. The palate is thick yet spiked with acidity, as prune and raisin flavors meet with clove and caramel."
Beaulieu Vineyard 2015 Pinot Noir (Carneros),Beaulieu Vineyard,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.3%,$32,91,Virginie Boone,"Strawberry tea and rose-petal aromas open this wine with nuance and elegance, a nice entry to a velvety texture that's both spicy and sublime. Forest floor and clove contribute complexity as a touch of smoky oak rises on the finish."
Château Val Joanis 2010 Tradition Roussanne (Luberon),Château Val Joanis,White,Tradition,Roussanne,"Luberon, Rhône Valley, France",13%,,87,Joe Czerwinski,"This is 100% Roussanne, from one of the highest vineyards in the Luberon. It's fruity and direct, a well-made medium-bodied white, boasting a panopoly of fruit flavors ranging from pear to pineapple, and hints of melon as well. Drink it over the next several months."
Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2008 Château Julia Assyrtiko Assyrtico (Drama),Domaine Costa Lazaridi,White,Château Julia Assyrtiko,"Assyrtico, Greek White","Drama, Greece",13.5%,$20,89,Susan Kostrzewa,"A snappy nose of citrus and grapefruit is followed by a very pretty balance of fresh apples and citrus and spice. Aromatic but dry, it will pair well with spicy cuisine or grilled seafood."
Quinta Vale do Armo 2010 Vila Jardim Red (Tejo),Quinta Vale do Armo,Red,Vila Jardim,"Touriga Nacional Blend, Portuguese Red","Tejo, Portugal",13.5%,$12,85,Roger Voss,"This wine shows juicy, ripe fruit without much structure. Full of red fruit, smoke tones and considerable acidity, this is a drink-now sipper."
Pine Ridge 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Pine Ridge,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Stags Leap District, Napa, California, US",14.1%,DrizlyVivino,87,,"Tastes like sweet, spicy blackberry jam, with an overripe note of prune lurking in the background, which will limit the wine's age-­worthiness. It's fine in tannins and acids, with plenty of elegance, but it seems too sweet for true classic Stags Leap character."
Salvatore Molettieri 1996 Vigna Cinque Querce  (Taurasi),Salvatore Molettieri,Red,Vigna Cinque Querce,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Taurasi, Southern Italy, Italy",,$32,85,,"The “vineyard of five oaks” yielded a rich, dark, earthy wine in '96, with sweet notes of molasses, brown sugar and soy sauce. Full-bodied and low in acidity, with plenty of tannin to lose, the question is whether the tannins will ever soften enough to come into balance."
Torbreck 2001 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa Valley),Torbreck,Red,The Factor,,"Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",,$85,89,,"On the nose, there's caramel, wheat and pine aromas; fruit on the palate is juicy and fat, and doesn't pick up oak flavors until the finish. A very good, tasty wine, though straightforward. 1,500 cases produced."
DFJ Vinhos 2015 Segada Red (Lisboa),DFJ Vinhos,Red,Segada,Portuguese Red,"Lisboa, Portugal",12.5%,$9,86,Roger Voss,"Full of berry fruits, this wine blends Touriga Nacional, Alfrocheiro and Merlot. It is ripe, juicy, perfumed and has good balance between acidity and fruitiness. Drink now."
Luminis 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Luján de Cuyo),Luminis,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Luján de Cuyo, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.3%,$15,80,Michael Schachner,"Rusty in color, this is gritty, murky and stewy on the nose. Stewy, mulchy, sweet berry flavors finish bitter and leafy."
Grassini 2017 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),Grassini,White,Reserve,Sauvignon Blanc,"Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California, US",13.3%,$45,91,Matt Kettmann,"Mineral-flecked aromas of wet stone and fresh cement kick off the nose of this bottling, which then leads into exotic citrus, lime-blossom and white-flower touches. There is a great grip to the sip right away, and then more rounded flavors of apple and Key lime pie emerge, yet that stony quality never wavers."
Barboursville Vineyards 2016 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Virginia),Barboursville Vineyards,Red,Reserve,Cabernet Franc,"Virginia, Virginia, US",13%,$25,88,Carrie Dykes,"Aromas of blackberry, leather and graphite lead to a palate that is driven by plum, tarragon and chai-spice flavors. This full-bodied wine offers parching tannins and racy acidity. The finish is long and dry, filled with sweet oak spices."
La Rochelle 2005 Paraiso Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),La Rochelle,Red,Paraiso Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.9%,$40,90,,"The vineyard has been a consistent source of good to great Pinot Noirs for Paraiso winery. Now La Rochelle dips into it, with successful results. It's a dry, elegantly silky but complex wine, with an array of cherry, raspberry, rose flower, cinnamon spice and smoky vanilla flavors, heightened with crisp acidity. Drink now."
Henriet-Bazin NV Hypolite Premier Cru Fût de Chêne Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),Henriet-Bazin,Sparkling,Hypolite Premier Cru Fût de Chêne Brut,Chardonnay,"Champagne, Champagne, France",12.5%,$75,94,Roger Voss,"Local forests on the Montagne de Reims provided the wood for aging this Champagne. The Chardonnay is rich as much as textured with fine maturity and ripe apple flavors that have been broadened by the toastiness. This is a great wine, textured and now mature."
Uptick Vineyards 2014 Hilda's Rosé (Russian River Valley),Uptick Vineyards,Rose,Hilda's,Rosé,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.7%,$22,88,Virginie Boone,"Made from a 50-50 split of Pinot Noir and Syrah, this pinkish wine is medium bodied and intensely electric in acidity, a taste of wild strawberry and waxy apple at its core. Lemony, it remains dry on the palate throughout, with some girth on the finish."
Renwood 2015 Indian Creek Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),Renwood,Red,Indian Creek Vineyard,Zinfandel,"Amador County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.5%,$40,92,Jim Gordon,"Big and bold, this wine gives most people what they want in a Zinfandel—mouth-filling, luscious, palate-drenching berry flavors and good structure, too. Firm tannins and supportive fruit acidity keep the fruit notes from being cloying and help the wine linger nicely on the finish."
Sidewood 2008 Reserve Syrah (Adelaide Hills),Sidewood,Red,Reserve,,"Adelaide Hills, South Australia, Australia",13%,$24,91,Joe Czerwinski,"Interestingly, Sidewood's 2008 Reserve Shiraz comes in considerably lower in alcohol than the regular bottling. It features a complex interplay of herb, spice and olive that gives it a stylistic resemblance resemblance to northern Rhône Syrahs. The tannins are silky, the finish long and balanced. Drink now–2018."
Renteria 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Renteria,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$32,89,,"Rich and full bodied, this is delicious to drink now for its array of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and toast flavors. The tannins are just a bit jagged, so give it a few hours in the decanter."
Sogrape 2004 Callabriga Reserva Red (Alentejo),Sogrape,Red,Callabriga Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Alentejo, Portugal",14.5%,$25,92,Roger Voss,"With two years of barrel and bottle aging, this wine is maturing attractively. The tannins remain firm, but the taste is broad, rich, a fine combination of solid black plums and wood spice, with a tight edge of acidity. Big, with bold brush strokes of flavor, but worth aging another two years."
Clos Venturi 2015 Cuvée 1769 Sciaccerellu (Corse),Clos Venturi,Red,Cuvée 1769,"Sciaccerellu, Other Red","Corse, France",13.5%,,88,Roger Voss,"This is an intense, rich wine with solid tannins and firm black fruit. Its plum and blackberry flavors are sustained by a structure that promises some medium-term aging. Drink from late 2018."
Banrock Station 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia),Banrock Station,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",13.5%,$5,84,Joe Czerwinski,"A bit chunky and lacking in elegance, but offers an assertive mouthful of cassis and vanilla flavors that would capably partner weeknight steaks or burgers. Imported by Pacific Wine Partners."
Babich 2005 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Babich,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Marlborough, New Zealand",,$13,84,Joe Czerwinski,"Aromas of peach and pineapple give way to tropical fruit flavors with just a trace of passion fruit. A bit fat and soft on the palate, then picks up a slightly bitter note on the finish. Imported by Select Fine Wine."
Cloninger 2000 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),Cloninger,White,Estate Grown,Chardonnay,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",,$16,88,,"Here's a good, rich Chardonnay, distinctive for its ripe array of tropical fruits, pears, peaches and oriental spices. It feels crisp and clean in the mouth, and finishes rich and spicy."
Graffigna 2008 Centenario Pinot Grigio (San Juan),Graffigna,White,Centenario,Pinot Grigio,"San Juan, Other, Argentina",13.5%,$13,83,Michael Schachner,"If you catch this wine soon, meaning before it goes belly up, you may like its peachy simplicity and ample palate weight. Lychee, melon and spiced-meat flavors are interesting up to a point, and the finish is generic, soft and clean. Drink immediately."
Bisceglia 2006 Terra di Vulcano  (Aglianico del Vulture),Bisceglia,Red,Terra di Vulcano,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Aglianico del Vulture, Southern Italy, Italy",13.5%,,86,,"Terra di Vulcano is a base line of wine from Bisceglia. The Agliancio del Vulture offers aromas of raspberry, strawberry, Indian spice and although the wine is big on ripe fruit flavors, it doesn't taste jammy or cooked."
Odette 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),Odette,Red,Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Stags Leap District, Napa, California, US",15.2%,$98,94,Virginie Boone,"Chocolate-cherry and mocha fill the air and palate in this densely delicious inaugural offering from a new estate, set in the heart of the appellation. At this sister property of the PlumpJack and Cade wineries, with the same owners, there's no skimping on quality. The wine is medium in weight and lengthy, subtle in oak and integrated tannin, with a lovely finish."
Château Grand Destieu 2005 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),Château Grand Destieu,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,87,Roger Voss,"86-88 Barrel sample. A modern style of wine, blackly fruity and polished with spice and herbs, while surprisingly advanced with rich tobacco and chocolate flavors."
William Hill Estate 2015 Chardonnay (North Coast),William Hill Estate,White,,Chardonnay,"North Coast, North Coast, California, US",13.8%,$17,86,Jim Gordon,"Vanilla aromas and sweet butter and baked apple flavors make this medium-bodied wine appealing and easy to enjoy. The acidity is very light, and the texture soft."
Markus Molitor 2012 Ürziger Würzgarten Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),Markus Molitor,White,Ürziger Würzgarten Spätlese,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",7.5%,$33,93,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Dramatically ripe, this delicately framed spätlese is a showcase of pristine, sunny peach and Meyer lemon flavors accented by caramel and crystallized honey. It's nuanced as well, darting with acidity and touches of sea salt and slate that persist."
Flora Springs 1999 Rutherford Hillside Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Flora Springs,Red,Rutherford Hillside Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$100,87,,"Ripe and fruity, with intense and penetrating black-currant flavors and a spicing from toasty oak. Quite dry, and a bit acidic, leading to a tart finish. A bit austere now, sort of a Johnny-one-note, but could gain in complexity down the road. —S.H."
Fontana Candida 2007  Frascati Superiore,Fontana Candida,White,,White Blend,"Frascati Superiore, Central Italy, Italy",12.5%,$12,84,,"A much-loved, easy-drinking wine from near the Italian capital, Fontana Candida is one of Rome's most popular dinner companions. The wine is fresh and easy with simple aromas of stone fruit, citrus and a lean mouthfeel."
Simpatico 2017 Coalesce Red (Red Mountain),Simpatico,Red,Coalesce,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.1%,$28,87,Sean P. Sullivan,"Aromas of coffee, cocoa and dried herbs lead to reserved fruit flavors. It's straight down the fairway."
Luis Pato 2001 Vinha Formal White (Beiras),Luis Pato,White,Vinha Formal,Portuguese White,"Beiras, Portugal",,,88,Roger Voss,"This wood-aged wine, made from the local Bical grape, is reminiscent of an Australian Sémillon, packed with oily, citrus fruit, with toast and rich flavors. Who says Portugal can't produce white wines which are ageworthy?"
La Universal 2007 Venus Red (Montsant),La Universal,Red,Venus,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Montsant, Catalonia, Spain",14%,$65,89,Michael Schachner,"This opens with gritty aromas of mineral, char, mushroom, leather and berry fruits. It feels cutting and juicy, but it has the body to handle it. The flavors of berry and cherry are bright and tight, while chocolate and earthy notes reside in the background. Toasty, dark and tough on the finish, drink this Syrah-Cariginan blend now through 2014."
Sean Minor 2010 Chardonnay (Central Coast),Sean Minor,White,,Chardonnay,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,DrizlyVivino,85,,"There's lots of zesty acidity in this ripe, forward Chardonnay. It features fruity flavors of oranges and apricots, with a touch of oak that lends a buttered toast note."
Viticcio 2016 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Viticcio,Red,Riserva,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",14%,,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with aromas of black plum, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of toasted oak. The chewy palate offers prune, espresso and star anise alongside tightly knit tannins. Drink 2021–2025."
Robert Weil 2012 Tradition Riesling (Rheingau),Robert Weil,White,Tradition,Riesling,"Rheingau, Germany",10%,$20,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Earthy, savory aromas subside to reveal fresh lemon and lime on this elegant, steely wine. Off-dry in style, it balances ripe pear and apple flavors with a sturdy backbone of acidity. Finishes moderately long."
Bargetto 2000 Merlot (California),Bargetto,Red,,Merlot,"California, California Other, California, US",14.2%,$12,84,,"Has good acidity and lovely tannins, which are soft and plush in the mouth, with good acidity. Feels great, but loses a few points because of green, unripe flavors that ride side by side with riper blackberry ones. That sharpness really kicks in on the finish. —S.H."
Hatcher 2002 Estate Zinfandel (Calaveras County),Hatcher,Red,Estate,Zinfandel,"Calaveras County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",,$18,88,,"Nice Zin, balanced and dry, with an easy, sillky mouth feel. Shows upfront spice, berry, cherry and coffee flavors. Notable for its harmony."
Canalicchio di Sopra 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),Canalicchio di Sopra,Red,Riserva,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$130,96,Kerin O’Keefe,"Underbrush, truffle, pressed violet, tilled soil, eucalyptus and mature berry aromas unfold on this structured, elegant red. It is still young and primary, offering red cherry, black raspberry, menthol, licorice and dried herb alongside youthfully austere tannins that need to unwind. This will benefit from another decade of cellaring."
Dürnberg 2017 Getränk Grüner Veltliner (Weinland Österreich),Dürnberg,White,Getränk,Grüner Veltliner,"Weinland Österreich, Austria",12.5%,$14,87,Anne Krebiehl MW,Slightly muddied lemon and pear notes on the nose lead to a fresh easy light palate. They are joined by that characteristic whiff of white pepper and a savory edge of sage. The finish is totally refreshing.
V. Sattui 2011 Syrah (Napa Valley),V. Sattui,Red,,,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.4%,$35,88,Virginie Boone,"This wine also contains small percentages of Petite Sirah and Grenache to good effect, providing a soft and approachable entry of well-balanced black fruit and leather."
Di Costanzo 2017 Montecillo Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Moon Mountain District Sonoma County),Di Costanzo,Red,Montecillo Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Moon Mountain District Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",14.3%,$95,95,Virginie Boone,"A new offering from the producer, from the famous high-elevation site above the Sonoma Valley, this wine is robust in red fruit, cassis and earthy on the nose. Seamless in youthful tannin and dusty crushed rock-like minerality, it is an outstanding debut from a tough but tremendously rewarding vintage when in the right hands. This will do well with more time in the bottle; enjoy best from 2022–2027."
D'Arenberg 2015 The Ironstone Pressings G-S-M (McLaren Vale),D'Arenberg,Red,The Ironstone Pressings,"G-S-M, Rhône-style Red Blend","McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$65,89,Christina Pickard,"When compared to the 2014, this vintage feels primary and even a little simple. Chances are it just needs a few more years in bottle, but for now this almost 50-50 blend of Grenache and Shiraz (with 5% Mourvèdre) oozes plums, raspberry, cola, ground pepper and warm earthy mineral characters, the Shiraz more prominent than the previous vintage. The palate is full figured, balancing plump fruit with spicy oak and chalky drying tannins that add that signature d'Arenberg texture. Drink 2021–2031."
Château du Pavillon 2013  Saint-Croix-du-Mont,Château du Pavillon,Dessert,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Saint-Croix-du-Mont, Bordeaux, France",14%,,87,Roger Voss,"From a fine vintage for sweet wines in Bordeaux, this is fruity and ready to drink. Good acidity is the key here, balancing the apricot and bitter orange sweetness. Drink now."
Château Moulin de Clotte 2009  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,Château Moulin de Clotte,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$16,87,Roger Voss,"Soft, warm and smoky wine, this has a finely layered wood flavor to go with the black currant and red berry fruits. It's dry, yet warm and ripe, finishing with freshness."
David Hill NV Farmhouse Red (America),David Hill,Red,Farmhouse,"Red Blends, Red Blends","America, US",13.8%,$11,85,Paul Gregutt,"A half dozen unrelated red grapes are tossed into the mix here, making a serviceable blend with no distinctive flavor or focus. It's a stewpot red, fine for everyday enjoyment."
Alexander the Grape 2011 The Conqueror Klipsun Vineyards Red (Red Mountain),Alexander the Grape,Red,The Conqueror Klipsun Vineyards,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.5%,$50,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah brings aromas of Mounds Bar, spice and cherry. The flavors are tightly wound, showing a mixture of fruit and barrel with a persistent finish. The oak rides heavy but there are good things going on."
Mumm Cuvée Napa NV Cuvee M  (Napa Valley),Mumm Cuvée Napa,Sparkling,Cuvee M,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",12.5%,$18,87,,"A tiny bit sweet, with lemon and peach flavors and a bit of a rough scour of acidity. Yet the creamy texture and clean yeasty finish make it a good sip of bubbly."
Davis Family 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Davis Family,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.1%,$50,90,,"Tasted in late summer of 2009, this Cab tasted fresh out of the barrel, with jammy cherry, black raspberry, blackberry and plum flavors, generously accented with smoky oak. Delicious now, but with the inherent balance to age for six years or so."
Semeli 2015 Feast Moschofilero (Peloponnese),Semeli,White,Feast,"Moschofilero, Greek White","Peloponnese, Greece",12%,$12,91,Susan Kostrzewa,"This stylish and distinctive wine starts with aromas of lemon blossom and slate, followed by flavors of exotic white fruits and citrus. A crisp mineral backbone gives the wine focus and flair. A delicious white at an affordable price."
Fess Parker 2007 Ashley's Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Fess Parker,Red,Ashley's,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$50,94,,"Tasted in March, 2009, this Pinot was dark, rich and tannic. Clearly too young to really show its best now. But it's an ager. Give it three or four years to let all the parts come together, when the cherries, blackberries, spices and oak should begin to become silky and sweet. Will improve through 2015."
Albert Bichot 2003 Domaine du Clos Frantin  (Clos de Vougeot),Albert Bichot,Red,Domaine du Clos Frantin,Pinot Noir,"Clos de Vougeot, Burgundy, France",,,90,Roger Voss,"This fine wine combines the new wood and modern fruit style of Bichot with the classic power of Clos de Vougeot. Toast and black fruits combine to make a wine which will develop slowly, giving ripe and powerful flavors along the way."
El Enemigo 2011 Bonarda (Mendoza),El Enemigo,Red,,"Bonarda, Other Red","Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.9%,$20,89,Michael Schachner,"Ripe, floral aromas of blackberry and minerals filter into a grapy, grabby palate. Flavors of iodine, licorice, black plum and cassis finish salty and leathery tasting, with a firm tannic grip and rubbery notes. This is short on refinement but generous in terms of body and fruit content."
Sawtooth 2005 Syrah,Sawtooth,Red,,,"Idaho, US",,$15,88,Paul Gregutt,"This is mostly Syrah, with small amounts of Cinsault, Mourvèdre and Grenache included. The Snake River Valley AVA crosses from Idaho into eastern Oregon; these are Idaho grapes as far as can be ascertained. The wine is tannic and well-made, with deeply-flavored, meaty fruit character. Wild berries and plums are suggested, with much darker streaks of coffee, licorice, smoke and earth. The alcohol (almost 15%) shows through in some residual heat."
Domaine de la Sauveuse 2009 Cuvée Carolle Rosé (Côtes de Provence),Domaine de la Sauveuse,Rose,Cuvée Carolle,Rosé,"Côtes de Provence, Provence, France",13%,$15,85,Roger Voss,"Fresh strawberry and caramel aromas start the wine well, but the palate has a bitter edge of almonds, lifed by some juicy acidity and a light apple skin aftertaste."
Italo Cescon 2014 Pinot Grigio (Veneto),Italo Cescon,White,,Pinot Grigio,"Veneto, Veneto, Italy",12%,$16,85,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of tropical fruit, yellow flower and a hint of nut lead the nose. On the informal palate, brisk acidity brightens banana, white peach and pear."
Ettore Germano 2014 Lazzarito Riserva  (Barolo),Ettore Germano,Red,Lazzarito Riserva,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",13.5%,$95,94,Kerin O’Keefe,"Pressed rose petal, truffle, crushed mint and cocoa shape the nose along with a whiff of camphor. The vibrant, chiseled palate features strawberry, sour cherry and licorice framed in taut fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. It closes on a note of exotic incense. Drink 2024–2034."
Poderi Elia 2012 Serracapelli  (Barbaresco),Poderi Elia,Red,Serracapelli,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$50,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Prune, leather, oak and balsamic aromas lead the nose of this wine. The palate shows oak, vanilla, coconut and fig flavors alongside close-grained tannins. The fruit is already starting to dry out so drink soon."
Chalk Hill 2006 FURTH Red (Chalk Hill),Chalk Hill,Red,FURTH,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Chalk Hill, Sonoma, California, US",15.2%,$150,92,,"Here's a Bordeaux blend that aims high and largely succeeds. It's soft and intricate despite the thick tannins, with a mouthfeel like wool. Turns flavorful in blackberries and black currants, with more feminine hints of violets and lavender, then shuts down again on a tannic finish. Better after 2012."
Bryter 2010 Inspired Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Bryter,Red,Inspired,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$95,91,,"A solid effort, dry, tannic and rich in fruit. It's succulent in blackberries, black currants, crême de cassis, dark chocolate and plums, with an overlay of toasty oak. It shows the modern, fruit-forward Napa style."
Bressia 2015 Monteagrello Malbec (Mendoza),Bressia,Red,Monteagrello,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$20,84,Michael Schachner,"Furry berry, cotton candy and herbal aromas are less than fresh. This Malbec is clampy, narrow and highly acidic. Minty flavors of plum skins are raw and a bit green, as is an edgy finish."
Spann Vineyards NV Betsy's Backacher Red (Russian River Valley),Spann Vineyards,Red,Betsy's Backacher,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$15,81,,"Simple, sweet and sour, with apricot and orange marmalade flavors. A blend of Merlot, Carignan, Syrah, Cab and Petite Sirah."
Terra di Briganti 2008 Martummè Aglianico (Sannio),Terra di Briganti,Red,Martummè,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Sannio, Southern Italy, Italy",13.5%,$24,89,,"Martummè is an austere Taurasi-style Aglianico (from the Sannio region, however) that places emphasis on richness, elegance and sophistication. Deep and penetrating in the mouth, it delivers a long succession of spice, leather, tobacco and black fruit aromas. Very nice."
Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2013 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Chateau Lafayette Reneau,White,Semi-Dry,Riesling,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",11.5%,$15,89,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Ripe, pristine pineapple, mango and honeydew burst from this luscious semi-dry Riesling. It's juicy and lush, boasting a tropical fruit flavor, but also structured and sprightly, with a surprising mineral finish."
Cigale 2007 Grenache-Mourvèdre-Shiraz G-S-M (Barossa Valley),Cigale,Red,Grenache-Mourvèdre-Shiraz,"G-S-M, Rhône-style Red Blend","Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$19,86,Joe Czerwinski,"This vintage of Cigale's GSM showcases more Grenache (63%) than in the past, which perhaps accounts for its slightly one-dimensional cherry fruitiness. Very supple, verging on syrupy in texture, it also shows a bit of warmth on the finish. Drink now–2012."
Domaine Marcel Deiss 2014 Langenberg White (Alsace),Domaine Marcel Deiss,White,Langenberg,"Alsace white blend, White Blend","Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$34,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Hints of sultana and cooked quince reach the nose suggesting richness. The palate, however, responds with streamlined freshness, ripe fruit and depth and gives us concentration rather than richness. Tangy citrus zest frames notions of ripe apple and quince while shadows of dried fruit still haunt aromatically. The finish is clean, totally satisfying and dry. This is soaring but hearty stuff."
Buty 2015 Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Buty,White,Conner Lee Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.8%,$42,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is a bit reductive out of the gate, opening to reveal aromas of pear, peach, melon, lees and spice. The palate is creamy and textured in feel. If the aromas come together, it could move up a notch."
Donati Family Vineyard 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paicines),Donati Family Vineyard,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paicines, Central Coast, California, US",13.8%,$25,88,Matt Kettmann,"Dried rose petals, black cherries, cedar and a sense of darkness pervade the nose on this wine from a relatively unknown appellation about 25 miles from the Monterey Bay. Flavors of minty chocolate, plums and cherry blossoms show on the lithe palate."
Sola 2017 Pinot Noir (California),Sola,Red,,Pinot Noir,"California, California Other, California, US",13.5%,$15,86,Jim Gordon,This medium-bodied wine is good in quality and serviceable for casual occasions. It shows earthy herbal aromas and sour cherry and rhubarb flavors.
Geyser Peak 2008 Merlot (Alexander Valley),Geyser Peak,Red,,Merlot,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$18,84,,"This is soft and simple, with mild cherry, spice and cedar flavors. It's not very rich, but it's nice and dry."
Tenuta di Fessina 2017 Erse Rosso  (Etna),Tenuta di Fessina,Red,Erse Rosso,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Etna, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13%,$25,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of smoke, scorched earth and toasted hazelnut lead the nose. The aromas carry on to the rather lean palate along with sour cherry, lively acidity and dusty, drying tannins."
Château Valandraud 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),Château Valandraud,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,96,Roger Voss,"95–97. Barrel sample. Promoted to Saint-Emilion's elite Premier Grand Cru Classé category, Valandraud's 2012 shows both a mineral character and intense acidity to go with the smooth and beautiful black currant fruits. Power and elegance."
Saintsbury 2017 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Saintsbury,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",13.7%,$45,90,Virginie Boone,"Plummy and brooding in dark cherry, this wine offers substantial up-front tannin and oak that mellows in the glass while presenting rich concentration. High-toned background acidity and jolts of baking spice counter the richer aspects well."
RustRidge 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Chiles Valley),RustRidge,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Chiles Valley, Napa, California, US",13.8%,$44,88,,"This is a big, powerhouse Cabernet that should develop bottle complexity over time. Right now, it's very dry and tannic, and the blackberry and black currant flavors are unintegrated with the oak. Better after 2010."
Wohlmuth 2018 Ried Hochsteinriegl Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),Wohlmuth,White,Ried Hochsteinriegl,Sauvignon Blanc,"Südsteiermark, Austria",13.5%,,97,Anne Krebiehl MW,"An initial hint of crushed ivy and citrus leaf peeks through on the nose. The palate then shows green-tinged ripeness, as if a juicy Mirabelle were spritzed with lime. All is bedded on a light-footed yet profound palate. It offers a gorgeous combination of smoothness and freshness. Drink by 2040."
Quintas de Melgaço 2015 Torre de Menagem Escolha White (Vinho Verde),Quintas de Melgaço,White,Torre de Menagem Escolha,Portuguese White,"Vinho Verde, Portugal",12%,$12,88,Roger Voss,"This is a blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura, a lively, fruity wine that has just a hint of a prickle on the tongue. It has apple and grapefruit flavors that are fresh and deliciously crisp. The wine is ready to drink."
Tololo 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),Tololo,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Curicó Valley, Chile",12.5%,$10,86,Michael Schachner,"With grapefruit and orange aromas, this is on the ripe side, but the feel is fresh and flavors of citrus, white pepper, arugula and briny melon get the job done. Drink this quaffer soon and it will satisfy; hold it too long and it will lose its fresh character."
IL Gioiello 2005 Estate Petite Sirah (Amador County),IL Gioiello,Red,Estate,Petite Sirah,"Amador County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",15.1%,$20,89,,"A nice example of Petite Sirah from up in the Sierra Foothills. The wine is full-bodied and tannic, with briary, brambly flavors of sweet black cherries, chocolate, thyme, pepper and charcoal. Immature and jammy now, and should develop slowly over the next decade."
Château Magdelaine 2009  Saint-Émilion,Château Magdelaine,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,94,Roger Voss,"There is dense, ripe fruit here, although with an austere, serious edge. The wine has firm yet juicy blackberry fruits along with concentrated tannins. It is firm, dark, with the potential for good red berry fruits."
N. Kendall Wines 2013 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),N. Kendall Wines,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12%,$35,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While ethereal in structure, there's a seductively penetrating appeal to this light-footed Pinot Noir. Initially pronounced notes of smoke, dried herb and cedar fade into a dusty rose and cherry perfume. Blossom and sage aromas extend into the palate, lending a sultry flair to brisk Maraschino cherry and raspberry flavors. The finish extends on a pleasant bite of bitter almond."
F X Pichler 2006 Smaragd Sauvignon Blanc (Wachau),F X Pichler,White,Smaragd,Sauvignon Blanc,"Wachau, Austria",,$65,87,Roger Voss,"The vines, rare in the Wachau, were planted because the family liked to drink Sauvignon Blanc, a simple explanation for a wine that is fresh, green and balanced between herbaceousness and tropical fruit flavors."
Clos Mimi NV Nini Syrah (California),Clos Mimi,Red,Nini,,"California, California Other, California, US",,$13,83,,"Pretty rustic, with sweet-and-sour cherry-candy flavors and a sharp, acidic mouth-feel. But with the right meats and cheeses, it will do fine."
La Casa Dell'Orco 2010  Greco di Tufo,La Casa Dell'Orco,White,,"Greco, Italian White","Greco di Tufo, Southern Italy, Italy",,$20,87,,"This is a rich, creamy Greco di Tufo that would pair with green olive tapenade or tomato bruschetta. Aromas of crushed white stone, melon and pear drive the fresh finish."
Maurodos 2012 Prima  (Toro),Maurodos,Red,Prima,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Toro, Northern Spain, Spain",14.5%,$24,88,Michael Schachner,"This warm-vintage blend of 90% Tinta de Toro and 10% Garnacha is superripe, such that it smells raisiny, with notes of licorice and pastry thrown in. A heavy, sticky, tannic palate feeds raisin, prune and chocolate flavors, while the finish is flat in texture and raisiny in flavor. Drink now."
La Yunta 2006 Torrontés (La Rioja),La Yunta,White,,Torrontés,"La Rioja, Other, Argentina",12.5%,$10,84,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of lychee fruit, pineapple, nectarine and baby powder are fairly typical and welcoming. The palate offers bright but somewhat nondescript flavors that ultimately tilt toward melon. The finish hangs in there, showing moderate grace and length. All in all this is decent Torrontes from La Rioja, a province to the north of Mendoza."
Abadía de Acón 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),Abadía de Acón,Red,Crianza,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",14.5%,$22,90,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of tree bark, cherry and cassis are rooty. This feels ripe, dense and generally well balanced. Rich flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, blackberry and black tea finish with creamy oak notes, herbal overtones and tobacco flavors. Drink through 2022."
Cosentino 2008 The Novelist Meritage White (California),Cosentino,White,The Novelist Meritage,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","California, California Other, California, US",14.1%,$18,83,,"A clumsy wine that aims for white Bordeaux in style and falls far short. There's plenty of oak and lees, but the underlying wine is thin and disappointing in citrus flavor."
Cedarville 2015 Estate Zinfandel (El Dorado),Cedarville,Red,Estate,Zinfandel,"El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.9%,$26,90,Jim Gordon,"A peppery, herbaceous aroma and savory spicy flavors make this full-bodied wine, grown at high elevation, a bit edgy but full of personality. The flavors, at first, resemble grilled fruit and beef juices, then ripe black plums flow in, complementing a texture that is firm and moderately tannic."
Birichino 2020 Petulant Naturel Malvasia Bianca Sparkling (Monterey),Birichino,Sparkling,Petulant Naturel Malvasia Bianca,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Monterey, Central Coast, California, US",13%,$25,91,Matt Kettmann,"From 31-year-old vines, this bubbly is all kinds of wild, starting with a very cloudy appearance then leading into aromas of grapefruit soda, apple sauce and banana. That unique combination shows strongly on the palate as well, where tropical hints of mango and makrut lime add to the attention-grabbing format."
Eighty Four 2016 Albariño (Napa Valley),Eighty Four,White,,Albariño,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.8%,$28,94,Virginie Boone,"This strengthens the argument that there's a place for different kinds of white wines to be made in the Napa Valley, emphasizing fruit freshness and acidity without sacrificing flavor or soul. Juicy apricot and green apple ride a wave of unoaked refreshment and refinement, all within a crisp framework of deliciousness. Lavender and honeysuckle seduce quietly."
Cabana Wines 2014 Chardonnay (Lodi),Cabana Wines,White,,Chardonnay,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",13.5%,$24,89,Jim Gordon,"Like a home-baked apple pie without the sweetness, this light-bodied wine smells of sliced apples, nutmeg and cinnamon and tastes fruity and lightly spicy. The texture is very smooth and gentle, too."
Marcarini 2006 Fontanazza  (Dolcetto d'Alba),Marcarini,Red,Fontanazza,"Dolcetto, Italian Red","Dolcetto d'Alba, Piedmont, Italy",13%,$17,86,,"An interesting nose of fruit and something a little wild; animal and funky. Not for everybody, and perhaps the funkiness was a little over the top, but an enjoyable wine for those who enjoy old-fashioned Dolcettos."
Domaine la Gemière 2017 Cuvée Initiale  (Sancerre),Domaine la Gemière,Red,Cuvée Initiale,Pinot Noir,"Sancerre, Loire Valley, France",12.5%,$22,86,Roger Voss,"This light, tank-aged wine goes for the fruit. Red-currant flavors give freshness to the soft tannins. The acidity and smoky edge add to the attraction. Drink now."
Lusco 2016 Albariño (Rías Baixas),Lusco,White,,Albariño,"Rías Baixas, Galicia, Spain",13%,$25,85,Michael Schachner,"Golden in color and heavy on the apricot and peach aromas, this seems just past its prime. Citrusy acidity keeps the palate jumpy, while apple and spiced pear flavors lose steam on the unsculpted finish."
Desert Wind 2006 Desert Wind Vineyard Sémillon (Wahluke Slope),Desert Wind,White,Desert Wind Vineyard,Sémillon,"Wahluke Slope, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$15,83,Paul Gregutt,"Given a moderate 10 weeks of aging time in American oak barrels, this lightweight Sémillon acquires a bit more impact than the winery's Bare Naked (all-stainless) bottling. The fruit is still thin and generic, but the barrel time adds some much-needed heft to the finish, and takes the edge off the phenolics."
Alma Negra 2008 Pinot Noir (Mendoza),Alma Negra,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$30,88,Michael Schachner,"Quite good and honest, with full raspberry, cherry and tea aromas along with a hint of grassiness. The palate is dark and full-bodied, with toasty cherry and herbal tea flavors. Finishes long, full and several steps ahead of most of the competition. Drink now."
Pegasus Bay 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Waipara),Pegasus Bay,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Waipara, New Zealand",13%,$19,88,Joe Czerwinski,"A rich, mouthcoating, viscous style, with 24% Sémillon blended in and kept on the lees for nine months prior to bottling. Honeyed stone fruits (plum and peach) and its round, supple nature make it easy to drink."
Il Chiosso 2016  Fara,Il Chiosso,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Fara, Piedmont, Italy",13%,$28,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of leather, camphor and underbrush follow over to the palate together with notes of salted game and dried cherry. Firm acidity and tight close-grained tannins leave an austere, rather astringent finish."
Testarossa 2013 Sanford &amp; Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Testarossa,Red,Sanford & Benedict Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$64,93,Matt Kettmann,"From a historic vineyard planted in 1971, this bottling show savory and dark notes of strawberry, raspberry, licorice, slate, sage and a touch of oak smoke. The palate boasts earthy structure and vibrant acidity, with flavors of slightly bitter cherry fruit, beet juice and bay leaf."
Glenora 2014 Oak Free Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),Glenora,Red,Oak Free,Cabernet Franc,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12%,$18,87,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Fermentation and maturation without oak casts a spotlight onto this unadorned Cabernet Franc. Sweet-tart black cherry and berry notes on the nose and palate are accented by streaks of green leaf and violet. It's not a deeply concentrated wine but refreshing, fringed by fine soft tannins and a touch of granite minerality on the finish."
Cline 1999 Syrah (California),Cline,Red,,,"California, California Other, California, US",13.6%,$10,85,,"On the nose and the palate of this black beauty, dried spice and mulchy-cedar flavors envelope a caramel-cherry backbone. Has decent balance, and finishes with dry wood, minerals, hot spices and plenty of black pepper."
Panther Creek 2000 Arcus Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Panther Creek,Red,Arcus,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13%,$60,91,,"A sniff reveals smoked meats, bacon, coffee and leather. The flavors are clean and pure—there's an abundance of inky black cherry and plum. The balance between juicy flavorful fruit and firm mouthcoating tannins is just right. Muscular but not overbuilt."
Van Ruiten 2004 Pinot Gris (Lodi),Van Ruiten,White,,,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",,$12,81,,"Sweet and insipid, with a heavy, gluey texture and flavors of stewed tree fruits."
Andeluna 2004 Winemaker's Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Andeluna,Red,Winemaker's Selection,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.2%,$13,85,Michael Schachner,"Mocha, coffee and other oak-based aromas are front and center on the nose. The palate is quite sweet and rich, with cola and dark fruit flavors. Generally speaking this wine has the right qualifications to make a positive impression; it is, however, oaky and on the stewy side. Imported by Kysela Pere et Fils, Ltd."
Villa La Selva 1998 Selvamaggio Sangiovese (Toscana),Villa La Selva,Red,Selvamaggio,Sangiovese,"Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13%,$27,86,Michael Schachner,"This 100% Tuscan Cabernet has struggled for ripeness in the past couple of vintages, and the 1998 is fairly green at the core. Beyond that it has a nice feel and racy tannins. But the murky, somewhat underripe flavor profile is a hurdle that it just can't clear. This type of wine makes one wonder about Cabernet's performance in central Tuscany. —M.S."
Tasca d'Almerita 2017 Guarnaccio Perricone (Sicilia),Tasca d'Almerita,Red,Guarnaccio,"Perricone, Italian Red","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13%,$22,92,Kerin O’Keefe,"Smooth and savory, this polished red has an enticing nose showing black-skinned berry, wild mint, blue flower and culinary spice. The juicy palate delivers ripe Marasca cherry, red currant, star anise and white pepper set against taut, refined tannins. Enjoy through 2025."
Château Liversan 2012  Haut-Médoc,Château Liversan,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Haut-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",13%,$26,90,Roger Voss,"Liversan makes a serious style of wine from its 125-acre vineyard, situated in the north of the Haut-Médoc. Dense, this is balanced between the black plum fruits and dry tannins. It's a wine for long-term aging, so drink from 2018."
Bosco Nestore 2017 B  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),Bosco Nestore,Red,B,"Montepulciano, Italian Red","Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Central Italy, Italy",13%,$12,85,Alexander Peartree,"Menthol and thyme are restrained on the nose, with tart red cherry arising on the light-bodied palate. The delicate tannins show a polished nature, with the acidity driving everything along."
Bryn Mawr Vineyards 2019 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Bryn Mawr Vineyards,Rose,Rosé of,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",12.3%,$25,88,Paul Gregutt,"Picked early and barrel fermented, this is a bright and fresh rosé with a tasty fruit mix of watermelon, strawberry and raspberry. It doesn't move much past that, but most rosés are not expected to delivers depth and complexity. Fresh fruit is the goal here, and quite successfully met."
Château Suduiraut 2010 Castelnau de Suduiraut  (Sauternes),Château Suduiraut,Dessert,Castelnau de Suduiraut,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Sauternes, Bordeaux, France",,$35,91,Roger Voss,"Made from young vines, this is the second wine of Suduiraut. It has young, honeyed character, with a ripe, opulent texture that lays bitter orange fruits over drier noble rot flavors. It is so delicious now, but will be better from 2017."
Mount Fishtail 2014 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Mount Fishtail,White,Single Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,"Marlborough, New Zealand",12%,$15,88,Joe Czerwinski,"This is on the more herbal side of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum, showing obvious notes of tomato leaf and boxwood, but there's ample white grapefruit to back up those green elements. This medium-bodied wine finishes long and crisp."
Tallulah 2004 Syrah (Sonoma Coast),Tallulah,Red,,,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",,$28,88,,"Smoky, rich and dramatic. Opens with peppery, new oaky aromas leading to deep, lush flavors of ripe blackberries, blueberries and chocolate. Almost perilously sweet, but saved by a tannic finish. Drink now and for a few years."
Left Coast Cellars 2014 Suzanne's Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Left Coast Cellars,Red,Suzanne's Estate Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.1%,$50,91,Paul Gregutt,"A chocolaty frame wraps around the tightly wound cherry-fruit core. There are delicious seams of coffee, vanilla and caramel, along with notes of tea and tobacco. It's fully accessible and intriguingly complex."
Caves Aliança 2011 Alabastro Reserva Red (Alentejano),Caves Aliança,Red,Alabastro Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Alentejano, Portugal",14.5%,$22,89,Roger Voss,"A dark and richly dense wine, this is packed with black fruit notes and concentrated tannins. Aged in French and American oak, it has a strongly spicy character, with bright acid and a solid tannic structure. Drink after 2015."
Sable Ridge 1999 Hensley-Lauchland Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),Sable Ridge,Red,Hensley-Lauchland Vineyard Old Vine,Zinfandel,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",,$20,89,,"Opens with the prettiest wildberry and brambly, peppery aromas, and gorgeous, sumptuously fruity flavors.  It's round and supple, with some nice weight; a sheer joy to drink.  Of course, it's soft, but that's warm country old-vine Zin for you."
Billsboro 2019 Sawmill Creek Vineyards Albariño (Finger Lakes),Billsboro,White,Sawmill Creek Vineyards,Albariño,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12.7%,$24,86,Alexander Peartree,"Lemon and peach aromas are covered in a savory blanket of yeast on the nose. The palate is streamlined in feel, driven by racy acidity that leads to a lingering lemon-juice tone."
Domaine Jean-Luc Mader 2012 Rosacker Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Domaine Jean-Luc Mader,White,Rosacker Grand Cru,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13.5%,$39,93,Roger Voss,"The chalk soil of the Rosacker vineyard has produced a rich, intensely fruity wine that is shot through with steely minerality and a wonderful perfumed character. It's so crisp and fresh while also being densely textured and complex. The wine has a long future, drink from 2017."
Claar 2018 Estate Grown &amp; Bottled White Bluffs Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Claar,Red,Estate Grown & Bottled White Bluffs,Merlot,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.1%,$30,88,Sean P. Sullivan,The aromas offer notes of black currant and dried herbs. The fruit flavors are plush in feel with the concentration dialed back a bit. Orange peel flavors linger on the finish.
Harvest Moon 2005 Estate Dry Gewürztraminer (Russian River Valley),Harvest Moon,White,Estate Dry,Gewürztraminer,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",12.5%,$18,85,,"Spicy and fruity and, as the label says, dry. It shows crisp acids and a bright, delicately clean mouthfeel. Kind of like a Sauvignon Blanc except for the exotic tropical fruit and Asian spice flavors."
Château Nozières 2011  Cahors,Château Nozières,Red,,Malbec,"Cahors, Southwest France, France",14.5%,$13,83,Roger Voss,"Earthy in character, this is a rustic wine. It does have attractive red fruits, and balancing acidity but these elements come up against a barnyard character and firm tannins."
Casa Montes 2014 Ampakama Chardonnay (San Juan),Casa Montes,White,Ampakama,Chardonnay,"San Juan, Other, Argentina",13%,$11,84,Michael Schachner,"Tropical aromas revolve around lemon-lime. This is acidic without much body. Flavors of lemon, melon, mango and green apple are lean and finish with tangy, pithy citrus flavors."
Tenute Orestiadi 2016 Molino a Vento Rosato (Terre Siciliane),Tenute Orestiadi,Rose,Molino a Vento,"Rosato, Rosé","Terre Siciliane, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",12.5%,$12,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"Fruity and fresh, this has aromas of red berry and pomegranate. The scents flow through to the easygoing palate along with raspberry and bright acidity."
Casa de Vila Verde 2015 Tiroliro White (Vinho Verde),Casa de Vila Verde,White,Tiroliro,Portuguese White,"Vinho Verde, Portugal",10.5%,$10,86,Roger Voss,"The wine is off dry, fruity and refreshing. It has lively citrus acidity as well as sliced apple crispness. The wine has the lightest prickle on the tongue, leaving a bright aftertaste. Drink now."
Château Gruaud Larose 2009  Saint-Julien,Château Gruaud Larose,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Julien, Bordeaux, France",,$90,93,Roger Voss,"Initially wood dominates, but this is a stage after bottling. Because then the ripe, smooth fruit comes in, pouring through with black fruits, very ripe and juicy. As this wine develops, this rich fruit will be its main character."
Chatter Creek 2003 Jack Jones Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Chatter Creek,Red,Jack Jones Vineyard,,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$22,88,Paul Gregutt,"Despite its youth it's ready to rock, with appealing varietal fruit, sparked by a nose that says this is what Syrah should be, very pretty and forward. It's a bright and snappy wine, spiced up with plenty of pepper."
Lowden Hills 2003 Win Chester Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Lowden Hills,Red,Win Chester,Merlot,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$24,86,Paul Gregutt,"This is the estate vineyard, located in the flat, dry western end of the Walla Walla Valley. It's 95% Merlot with a splash of Syrah and Cab Franc, and it is dark, tannic and straightforward. What's missing is the extra detail and complexity that would add interest to the roasty-toasty tannins."
Chehalem 2012 Ridegcrest Vineyards Wind Ridge Block Riesling (Ribbon Ridge),Chehalem,White,Ridegcrest Vineyards Wind Ridge Block,Riesling,"Ribbon Ridge, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",12.7%,$29,91,Paul Gregutt,"This block selection shows a delicate, elegant touch in this vintage, opening with pretty floral accents and continuing with light but compelling flavors of citrus and honeysuckle. There is a well-tuned bitter streak, presumably from some skin contact, and a refreshing minerality throughout."
Domaine Tortochot 2017 Vieilles Vignes  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Domaine Tortochot,Red,Vieilles Vignes,Pinot Noir,"Gevrey-Chambertin, Burgundy, France",13%,$80,88,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Reduction still dominates the nose of this wine with its sulfide haze. The palate is brighter and shows some gentle red fruit on a light, slightly dilute palate. However, the reduction clings on, so this wine really should be decanted."
Gérard Bertrand 2014 Gris Blanc Rosé (Pays d'Oc),Gérard Bertrand,Rose,Gris Blanc,Rosé,"Pays d'Oc, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",12.5%,$17,88,Lauren Buzzeo,"This pale salmon rosé is fresh and clean.

Buccia Nera 2011 Donna Patrizia White (Toscana),Buccia Nera,White,Donna Patrizia,White Blend,"Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$10,85,,"This is a blend of Trebbiano, Malvasia and Grechetto. The mildness of its fruity bouquet and the leanness of its mouthfeel suggest that it should be paired with tuna salads or steamed dumplings."
Parducci 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino),Parducci,Red,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mendocino, Mendocino County, California, US",,$14,85,,"This must have been one tannic wine for Parducci to sit on it for six years. Those tannins have resolved, and the wine is soft and drinkable, but still with a firm enough backbone to stand up to the sweet blackberry and cherry flavors."
The Withers Winery 2016 Claire's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),The Withers Winery,Red,Claire's Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",13.8%,$47,94,Jim Gordon,"This wine has a wild side, bringing out the savory smoky singed-rosemary and cooked-cherry elements of the varietal, with great balance aided by firm acidity and tannins. With its spicy aromas and layered concentrated flavors, this should improve with some age. Best after 2021."
Naia 2014 Ducado de Altan Verdejo (Rueda),Naia,White,Ducado de Altan,"Verdejo, Spanish White","Rueda, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$15,84,Michael Schachner,"Sweaty aromas of gym bag, nettle and grapefruit come in front of a citric, astringent palate with grapefruit-like acidity. Heavy, pithy citrus flavors finish similarly."

Now mature, it's very elegant. Drink now."
Loriñon 2006 Reserva  (Rioja),Loriñon,Red,Reserva,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$18,86,Michael Schachner,"Smells full but reduced, with a foxy, candied leaning and aromas of vitamins and minerals. Feels big, bulky, grabby and thick, with baked blackberry and plum flavors. Full on the finish, with some heat."
Wittmann 2018 100 Hills Dry Riesling (Rheinhessen),Wittmann,White,100 Hills Dry,Riesling,"Rheinhessen, Germany",12%,$16,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Hints of caramelized honey and crisp nectarine collide in this delightfully sunny yet deeply mineral dry Riesling. Medium bodied and spry on its feet, it fills the palate with a crush of zesty citrus and stone fruit flavors. The finish lingers on strikes of steel and earth. An exceptional value wine with elegance."
Alexander Valley Vineyards 2004 Estate Syrah (Alexander Valley),Alexander Valley Vineyards,Red,Estate,,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14%,$20,86,,"Nice, easy-drinking Syrah, soft in acids and tannins and dry, with pleasant marmalade flavors of cherries, rhubarbs and blackberries, with a rich edge of peppery, nutmeg spices and vanilla-accented oak. Drink now."
Enrico Serafino 2007 Diauleri  (Nebbiolo d'Alba),Enrico Serafino,Red,Diauleri,Nebbiolo,"Nebbiolo d'Alba, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$32,87,,"This is a silky and soft Nebbiolo with bright berry aromas and simple spice nuances. There's an elegant, feminine quality to this red wine, but it also shows power and determination."
Balletto 2017 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Balletto,White,Estate Grown,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.6%,$29,90,Virginie Boone,"With a generosity of oak and textured viscosity, this appellation wine offers great value and quality, with rich, rewarding layers of Gravenstein apple, pear and nutmeg."
Delas Frères 2017 La Galopine  (Condrieu),Delas Frères,White,La Galopine,Viognier,"Condrieu, Rhône Valley, France",14%,$68,93,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While earthen and smoky initially, this bold Viognier reveals zesty tangerine and white-floral perfume with time and aeration. It's a hefty wine that collapses in waves of peach and apricot on the palate. This classic representation of Condrieu should hold well through 2027."
Cave de Ribeauvillé NV Giersberger Cacher Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),Cave de Ribeauvillé,Sparkling,Giersberger Cacher,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Crémant d'Alsace, Alsace, France",12%,,86,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A high-toned nose makes earthy yeast notes seem more heady than they are. The palate is frothy and almost austere, with a slightly bitter edge softened by dosage."
Waterbrook 2009 Rosé Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),Waterbrook,Rose,Rosé,Sangiovese,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$13,88,Paul Gregutt,"Spicy and completely dry, this fresh and fruity rosé is a pretty strawberry and salmon shade, with persistent flavors of cherry candy, lemon oil and nougat. There's a nice citrus snap to the finish."
Rijckaert 2017 En Crêches  (Saint-Véran),Rijckaert,White,En Crêches,Chardonnay,"Saint-Véran, Burgundy, France",13%,$34,90,Roger Voss,"Luscious and rich, this wine has a mineral edge that will allow it to age. Tropical fruits combine with fresh citrus to add fruitiness to the structure. Drink from 2019."
Vega Moragona 2008 Viñas Viejas Tempranillo (Ribera del Júcar),Vega Moragona,Red,Viñas Viejas,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Júcar, Central Spain, Spain",14.5%,$18,88,Michael Schachner,"Creamy oak, mocha and ripe berry and plum aromas make for a sweet-smelling bouquet. In the mouth, this mature Tempranillo is lively enough, with cocoa, spice, raw oak and modest berry flavors. A creamy, slightly resiny feel defines the finish."
Viña Chocalan 2018 Gran Reserva Origen Chardonnay (San Antonio),Viña Chocalan,White,Gran Reserva Origen,Chardonnay,"San Antonio, Chile",,$18,86,Michael Schachner,"Nectarine and an unusual hint of passion fruit set up an oily palate that's full in weight. Oddly tropical flavors are salty and suggest passion fruit, while this feels lively and tastes briny on the finish."
Domaine Saint Gayan 2001 Red (Côtes du Rhône),Domaine Saint Gayan,Red,,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Côtes du Rhône, Rhône Valley, France",,$12,87,Roger Voss,"This is very superior Côtes-du-Rhône, since the vines are actually in Côtes-du-Rhône-Villages. But winemaker Jean-Pierre Meffre prefers to keep the name simple and the wine uncomplicated. Sweet, ripe fruit, solid tannins and red fruit flavors make this very attractive."
Terras de Alter 2012 Telhas Red (Alentejano),Terras de Alter,Red,Telhas,Portuguese Red,"Alentejano, Portugal",15%,$30,91,Roger Voss,The wine is packed with super-ripe fruit that gives density and concentration. It is rich with dark plum flavors and integrated acidity. The alcohol does give a burning sensation on the tongue which is a shame. The aftertaste however is full of acidity and fruitiness. Drink this opulent wine from late 2016.
Director's 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),Director's,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$23,87,Virginie Boone,"Combining 84% Cab with Malbec, Merlot and Syrah, this is a savory, thick and robust wine, ripe in black cherry and plum. Generous oak and tannin add weight and length, with a lurking hint of dried herb and cedar on the finish."
MontGras 2006 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Colchagua Valley),MontGras,Red,Reserva,,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",14.5%,$13,86,Michael Schachner,"Earth and bacon aromas meld into darker and fuller berry notes, while the medium-bodied palate shows solid but generic strawberry and raspberry flavors. There's nothing unusual or wrong with this wine; it's ripe, moderately textured and even shows some light milk chocolate throughout."
Van Zellers 2015 Rufo do Vale D. Maria Branco White (Douro),Van Zellers,White,Rufo do Vale D. Maria Branco,Portuguese White,"Douro, Portugal",13%,$17,86,Roger Voss,"Produced from high-altitude (1,800 feet) vines, this wine is ripe while also crisply fresh. Its lime and lemon flavors are balanced by the mineral texture and intense final acidity. Drink now."
Moulin de la Roque 2020 Les Hauts du Vallon Rosé (Bandol),Moulin de la Roque,Rose,Les Hauts du Vallon,Rosé,"Bandol, Provence, France",13.5%,$23,88,Roger Voss,"A rich wine, full of ripe red berry and red currant fruits, this is full-bodied and ready to drink.

The palate offers ripe blackberry, black cherry, mocha and allspice alongside firm tannins. It ends on a note of bitter almond."
Goldschmidt 2006 Plus Game Ranch Single Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Goldschmidt,Red,Plus Game Ranch Single Vineyard Selection,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$150,98,,"The 2006 vintage was erratic, but Nick Goldschmidt has pulled a rabbit out of a hat with this fabulously complex and rewarding 100% Cabernet. It's classic Oakville, dry, tannic and elegant, and the way the blackberry and black currant flavors marry the new oak is simply wonderful. The Game Ranch Vineyard has been source to some of Goldschmidt's greatest Cabernets over the past decade. This is one of those wines that's compelling to drink now, but should evolve over the next 10–15 years."
Goldschmidt 2006 Game Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Goldschmidt,Red,Game Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$70,92,,"Big, tannic and very fine. Shows the classic black currant and cedar flavors of Oakville, with an astringent mouthfeel that strongly suggests aging. Made from 100% Cab, it's beautiful now for its lush softness, and should develop for an additional six years, at least."
Valle dell'Acate 2018 Bellifolli Insolia (Sicilia),Valle dell'Acate,White,Bellifolli,"Insolia, Italian White","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",12.5%,$18,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Citrus blossom and yellow stone fruit aromas form the nose.

Raeburn 2018 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Raeburn,White,,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14%,$20,90,Virginie Boone,"This is a creamy, voluptuous and richly layered white wine, smooth and overdelivering on its price point in appealing flavors of peach and vanilla."
Heron 2012 Merlot (Mendocino County),Heron,Red,,Merlot,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",13%,$14,86,Virginie Boone,"Medium-bodied and well-priced for the quality, this Merlot is herbal in cassis and red cherry flavors, on the elegant side of the spectrum, and relatively low in alcohol. The tannins are firm and mellowed, the finish just fine."
Freixenet NV Carta Nevada Brut Sparkling (Cava),Freixenet,Sparkling,Carta Nevada Brut,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Cava, Catalonia, Spain",12%,$9,85,Michael Schachner,"Neutral for the most part, with fresh acidity, light bubbles and basic apple and peach flavors. A little sweet and confected but perfectly good. Solid for simple sipping and mimosas."
Intercoastal 2018 Estate Grown Musqué Clone Sauvignon Blanc (California),Intercoastal,White,Estate Grown Musqué Clone,Sauvignon Blanc,"California, California Other, California, US",13%,$22,87,Jim Gordon,"This medium-bodied wine is well balanced, fresh and fruity in flavor, and should be a crowd-pleaser. It's named for a varietal clone that often shows a floral character."
Château Mouton Rothschild 2011  Pauillac,Château Mouton Rothschild,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France",,$600,95,Roger Voss,"There is a lightness about this vintage of Mouton Rothschild. It doesn't take away from its quality but does give the wine poise and an attractive lift. The wine is based on solid tannins, then the ripe fruit builds layers of fruitiness and freshness. It is not likely to be one of the longest-aging Moutons, but it will be delicious. Drink from 2020."
Barton & Guestier 2000 French Tom Private Collection Merlot (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Barton & Guestier,Red,French Tom Private Collection,Merlot,"Vin de Pays d'Oc, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",,$14,83,,"Not as rich as B&G's Cabernet, which was co-released at the same time. This wine is dark, with earthy aromas, and turns tough and tannic in the mouth, with watered down flavors."
Domaine Valéry Renaudat 2018 Les Lignis Sauvignon Blanc (Reuilly),Domaine Valéry Renaudat,White,Les Lignis,Sauvignon Blanc,"Reuilly, Loire Valley, France",13%,,86,Roger Voss,"Grassy and herbal, this classic Sauvignon Blanc is also fruity and fresh with lime-juice flavors. It is tangy, bright and ready to drink."
Weibel Family 2019 Chardonnay (California),Weibel Family,White,,Chardonnay,"California, California Other, California, US",13%,$20,87,Jim Gordon,"This medium-bodied wine is fruity and friendly, topping pineapple and mint flavors with hints of butter and vanilla, and wrapping them in a soft texture."
Hard Row To Hoe 2009 Burning Desire Cabernet Franc (Lake Chelan),Hard Row To Hoe,Red,Burning Desire,Cabernet Franc,"Lake Chelan, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$35,87,Paul Gregutt,"A firm and focused Cabernet Franc, with just 5% Merlot in the blend, this spent 18 months in 50% new American oak. It's a straight-ahead style, with a red berry flavor and polished, proportionate tannins."
WillaKenzie Estate 1997 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),WillaKenzie Estate,White,,,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$15,87,,"A stylish wine from the French team at this winery. Green apples and herbs on the nose. Apple and almond flavors on the palate. Crisp but not sharp acidity and a long, clean finish."

The dense, almost syrupy palate offers yellow peach and candied orange before a short, flat finish."
Fairsing 2016 Dardis Pinot Noir (Yamhill-Carlton),Fairsing,Red,Dardis,Pinot Noir,"Yamhill-Carlton, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.8%,$62,89,Paul Gregutt,"The Dardis cuvée is taut and citric and shows wild berry fruit. Barreled for 10 months in 30% new French oak, it shows little impact of barrel flavors at this point in time; just the slightest hint of caramel streaking through the finish."
Beauregard 2017 Oeuf en Beton Bald Mountain Vineyard Chardonnay (Ben Lomond Mountain),Beauregard,White,Oeuf en Beton Bald Mountain Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Ben Lomond Mountain, Central Coast, California, US",12.5%,$50,93,Matt Kettmann,"Aged in a concrete egg, this bright bottling offers aromas of kumquat, lemongrass and light almond on the nose. There is tremendous grip to the sip, where bright and brilliant flavors of crisp lime and fresh lemon blossom extract meet with grapefruit zest. Very lively and tactile."

Columbia Crest 2009 Two Vines Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),Columbia Crest,Red,Two Vines,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",,$8,86,Paul Gregutt,"There is a surprising amount of fruit showing here; youthful, grapey, sweet and clean. The middle is a bit hollow, but the tannins kick back in for a smooth finish, with some charcoal and smoke filtering through."
Fitz-Ritter 2008 Estate Bottled Dry-Style Riesling (Pfalz),Fitz-Ritter,White,Estate Bottled Dry-Style,Riesling,"Pfalz, Germany",11.5%,$16,86,Joe Czerwinski,
Cave B 2008 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cave B,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$28,83,Paul Gregutt,"Cabernet Franc often shows more stem and herb than either Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon, but here there is little else to hang your hat on. Hard, chewy and tannic, it might best be drunk with a grilled steak, so those tough tannins are put to work."
Hartley-Ostini 2010 Hitching Post Perfect Set Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Hartley-Ostini,Red,Hitching Post Perfect Set,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$55,87,,"Some inherent imbalances, such as green notes and irregular tannins, limit this wine's ageability. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it now, especially with hearty barbecue and grilled beef. Dry and crisp in acidity, it has flavors of red currants, heirloom tomatoes and smoky oak."
Bigi 2007 Vipra Bianca White (Umbria),Bigi,White,Vipra Bianca,White Blend,"Umbria, Central Italy, Italy",12.5%,$12,85,,"Bigi offers a well-priced blend of Grechetto and Chardonnay that does a nice job of playing up the qualities of both grapes. The Grechetto, a native variety from central Italy, offers freshness and aromas of herbs and citrus. The Chardonnay offers body and density."
Georges Duboeuf 2018 Nouveau  (Beaujolais),Georges Duboeuf,Red,Nouveau,Gamay,"Beaujolais, Beaujolais, France",12.5%,VivinoGary's Wine,85,Roger Voss,"Grapes from southern Beaujolais, the land of the gold-colored stone buildings, are the main source of this wine. It's a typical, bubbly banana- and red-berry-flavored wine with a good streak of tannin and acidity. Of course, drink now."
Owen Roe 2010 Ex Umbris Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Owen Roe,Red,Ex Umbris,,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.2%,$28,88,Paul Gregutt,"A sweet scent of violet greets you first, along with a primary purple-fruit note. It's made in a forward, fruity style, and it offers finishing notes of anise and coffee liqueur."
Emerson Brown 2012 III Michaels Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Emerson Brown,Red,III Michaels Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$75,88,Virginie Boone,"Smoky oak and huge, dry tannins inform the personality of this full-bodied wine, a filling mix of black plum, cassis and blackberry. Sharper elements of cedar and dried herb are balanced by noteworthy drops of chocolate on the finish."
Quinta do Arrobe 2018 Mensagem Red (Tejo),Quinta do Arrobe,Red,Mensagem,Portuguese Red,"Tejo, Portugal",14%,$18,87,Roger Voss,"This three-generation family estate's latest release is ripe and structured, with solid tannins and rich black fruits. The edge of pepper from the alcohol does give the wine a bite and spoils the mature while still fruity wine. Drink now."
Château Camensac 2009 Barrel sample  (Haut-Médoc),Château Camensac,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Haut-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",,,93,Roger Voss,"92-94 Barrel sample. Big, ripe, juicy wine, the tannins very solid and dark. It has layers of new wood, power and considerable density."
Penfolds 2002 Cellar Reserve Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills),Penfolds,Red,Cellar Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Adelaide Hills, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$35,88,,"One of Penfolds' few Adelaide Hills-designated wines, and the only one available in the States at the moment. This Pinot is very good, with lifted, tangy cherry and plum fruit at the fore, and admirable intensity and length. But it's not as good as I've seen it in past vintages; this one has a pervading pickling-spice or barrel note that was a detraction for me. Imported by Southcorp Wines."
Stemilt Creek NV Earthen Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Stemilt Creek,Red,Earthen,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",15%,$15,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"Cocoa, green pepper and baking spice aromas are followed by broad, seamless flavors of green pepper, cherry and a bit of smoke. Pleasing acidity enlivens it."
Stags' Leap Winery 2009 Ne Cede Malis Petite Sirah (Stags Leap District),Stags' Leap Winery,Red,Ne Cede Malis,Petite Sirah,"Stags Leap District, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$80,90,,"This huge Petite Sirah shows such powerful blackberry, raspberry and Kahlua flavors. It's deliriously rich, so don't look for subtlety."
Joseph Cattin 2014 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),Joseph Cattin,White,,"Gewürztraminer, Gewürztraminer","Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$17,90,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Charming overtones of citrus herald the freshness of the 2014 vintage, while the palate shows richer fruit: golden Mirabelle plums and baked apricot with occasional swirls of rose blossom. The dry finish beautifully accentuates the freshness and is rather moreish."
Siegel 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),Siegel,Red,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Central Valley, Chile",13.5%,$10,86,Michael Schachner,"Spice and cola scents mix with smoky berry aromas. Tight and juicy in the mouth, with crisp red cherry and plum flavors and a medicinal edge. Solid and racy throughout."
Chime 2016 Pinot Noir (California),Chime,Red,,Pinot Noir,"California, California Other, California, US",13.5%,$12,86,Jim Gordon,This wine has a strong new-oak signature easy to detect in the vanilla and cinnamon aromas and the ginger-spice flavors that layer over good red-cherry notes underneath. It is medium to full bodied and highly stylized.
Garzón 2019 Reserva Pinot Noir Rosé (Uruguay),Garzón,Rose,Reserva Pinot Noir,Rosé,,13%,$20,88,Michael Schachner,"Mild aromas are clean and simple, as is the rest of this rosé of Pinot Noir. A medium-intensity palate is easygoing, with standard acidity. Generic, well-accepted rosé flavors finish clean and lightly citric."
Jäger 2016 Vorder Seiber Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),Jäger,White,Vorder Seiber Federspiel,Grüner Veltliner,"Wachau, Austria",12.5%,$25,90,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Conference pear and ripe lemon scents unfurl on the nose of this wine. The palate reinforces those aromas with juiciness and ease. A zesty, refreshing edge keeps it lively and taut, feeling citrus-centered, refreshing and clean."
Quinta do Vale Meão 2002 Red (Douro),Quinta do Vale Meão,Red,,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",14.5%,$50,88,Joe Czerwinski,"A bit crisper and lighter in weight than top vintages of this wine, but pleasing nevertheless, with cedar, herb and cherry flavors that merge harmoniously on the finish. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons."
Adega Ponte da Barca 2020 Grande Escolha White (Vinho Verde),Adega Ponte da Barca,White,Grande Escolha,Portuguese White,"Vinho Verde, Portugal",12%,$8,86,Roger Voss,"There is a light prickle on the tongue with this young, fruity wine. Fresh, off-dry and with a bright acidity, the wine has crisp grapefruit and a light spiciness. Drink now."
Claudia Springs 1998 Clone 115 - Vidmar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino),Claudia Springs,Red,Clone 115 - Vidmar Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Mendocino, Mendocino County, California, US",,$25,90,Paul Gregutt,"Tannic and firm, yet fleshy, with cherries and cherry tomatoes mixing it up. Some pleasing smoke and toast notes come from aging in oak barrels. Overall, it's elegantly styled but still on the young and tight side."
Pursued by Bear 2014 Baby Bear Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),Pursued by Bear,Red,Baby Bear,,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.2%,$60,90,Sean P. Sullivan,"Barrel aromas are at the fore, with notes of vanilla, coconut shavings and baking spice in front of cherry. The flavors bring a sense of richness, with barrel notes speckled throughout. Coconut flavors linger on the finish. It's a very stylistic interpretation of the variety."
Giacomo Fenocchio 2016 Bussia  (Barolo),Giacomo Fenocchio,Red,Bussia,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$58,93,Kerin O’Keefe,"This full-bodied red offers aromas of new leather, rose, camphor and forest berry. Firmly structured, the tight, focused palate offers dried black cherry, orange zest, licorice and tobacco set against a backbone of assertive tannins and bright acidity. Give it time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2026–2036."
Monte da Ravasqueira 2016 White (Alentejano),Monte da Ravasqueira,White,,Portuguese White,"Alentejano, Portugal",12.5%,$13,88,Roger Voss,"This is a delicious, ripe wine inspired by its Sémillon and Viognier. The lemon and grapefruit acidity is contrasted with the rich white stone fruits and warmth of this region. Drink from 2018."
Rudera 2004 Syrah (Stellenbosch),Rudera,Red,,,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",13%,$27,85,Susan Kostrzewa,"Earthy tobacco, smoke and spice on the nose and a fruit-forward palate make this expressive Shiraz an attractive cohort to smoked meat dishes and cheese assortments. The wine has a backbone of toasted oak and a smooth character."
Tablas Creek 2015 Patelin de Tablas Rosé (Paso Robles),Tablas Creek,Rose,Patelin de Tablas,Rosé,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",13%,$25,91,Matt Kettmann,"This is an extremely textural pink wine, with delicate touches of raspberry, strawberry, watermelon and the slightest twist of lime on the nose. The blend of 68% Grenache, 13% Counoise, 11% Mourvèdre and 8% Syrah shows grip and acidity on the sip, where lime-soaked nectarine and red apple flavors reign."
L'Ecole No. 41 2013 Estate Grown Perigee Seven Hills Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),L'Ecole No. 41,Red,Estate Grown Perigee Seven Hills Vineyard,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,DrizlyVivino,90,Sean P. Sullivan,"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. High-toned aromas of dried herb, barrel spice and red and black fruit are followed by well concentrated fruit flavors. The tannins show considerably more grip than is often seen from this site. Give it some time in the cellar to unwind. Best after 2021."
Château de Fonbel 2012  Saint-Émilion,Château de Fonbel,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,$20,86,Roger Voss,This wine has great fruit with soft tannins and accessible soft black currant fruitiness. A slight earthiness at the end needs to become better integrated. Drink from 2017.
Hendry 2014 Hendry Vineyard Pinot Gris (Napa Valley),Hendry,White,Hendry Vineyard,,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.7%,$18,88,Virginie Boone,"High-toned and 100% varietal, this ephemeral Pinot Gris was aged in stainless steel and is dry and waxy on the palate. Crisp green apple and lemon flavors are complemented by a mineral underbelly that makes this a food-friendly wine."
Grgich Hills 2005 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Grgich Hills,Red,,Zinfandel,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.9%,VivinoWine.com,84,,"Grgich's recent vintages of Zinfandel haven't been as good as they should be, and this one doesn't correct that impression. It's soft and more than a little sweet in cherry and blackberry flavors, with a tomato and beet edge that suggests uneven ripening."
Domaine Schoffit 2007 Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Sélection de Grains Nobles Larme de Lave Pinot Gris (Alsace),Domaine Schoffit,Dessert,Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Sélection de Grains Nobles Larme de Lave,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",5%,$90,95,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The nose is still shy but already tells of tender sweetness. The palate has a rounded earthy smoky element that grounds the luscious generous fruit of dried pear and supersweet Reine Claude and mirabelle plums. The sweetness of this SGN is balanced and almost fresh, but the intriguing thing is a kind of smoky, dark and mysterious core of stone."
Keller 2008 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Keller,Red,La Cruz Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$44,90,,"An elegant Pinot with a silky texture framing delicious flavors of ripe raspberries and cherries, elaborated with sweet spices and smoky sandalwood. A lovely wine to drink now."
Montresor 2014 Gran Guardia  (Lugana),Montresor,White,Gran Guardia,"Turbiana, Italian White","Lugana, Lombardy, Italy",12.5%,$23,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"This leads with aromas of white flower, toast and beeswax. The rather lean palate delivers yellow apple skin, citrus zest, a hint of roasted almond and a touch of vanilla alongside brisk acidity."
Flanagan 2014 Syrah (Bennett Valley),Flanagan,Red,,,"Bennett Valley, Sonoma, California, US",15.3%,$75,91,Virginie Boone,"This wine is on the edge, complex in white pepper and cool-climate characteristics of dried herb and leather. Brawny and full-bodied, it's also bright in underlying acidity, with plenty of elusive power."
Cadaretta 2015 Southwind Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Cadaretta,Red,Southwind,Malbec,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$65,87,Sean P. Sullivan,"Fruit for this wine comes from the winery's recently planted estate vineyard in the SeVein project. Aromas of cherry and spice lead to a highly structured palate, with slightly gritty tannins. The middle seems a bit missing. Tasted twice with consistent notes."
Rivera 2006 Violante Nero di Troia (Castel del Monte),Rivera,Red,Violante,"Nero di Troia, Italian Red","Castel del Monte, Southern Italy, Italy",13%,$16,86,,"Nero di Troia, a native grape of Southern Italy, shows its potential thanks to its aromas of berry fruit, Spanish cedar and drying minerals. The wine tastes simple and easy but manages to be elegant and penetrating nonetheless."
Alberti 154 2009 Tempranillo (Mendoza),Alberti 154,Red,,Tempranillo,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$13,83,Michael Schachner,"Heavily earthy and rubbery smelling, then big and bulky but out of whack on the palate. Tastes buttery and gummy, with generic berry fruit flavors that finish oaky."
Guenoc 2004 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),Guenoc,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Lake County, Lake County, California, US",,$13,82,,"There are some decent fruity flavors in this wine, and it's dry and clean. But it wants more concentration on the palate."

Linear and austere, the racy palate offers cranberry, sage and a hint of roasted coffee bean alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent finish."
Louis M. Martini 2000 Monte Rosso Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),Louis M. Martini,Red,Monte Rosso Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$55,88,,"Despite the difficulty of the vintage, this is a very good effort. It's bigger, fuller and more-extracted than the '99, with muscular cedar, cassis and graphite aromas and flavors. Drink 2008–2012."
Torres 1998 Reserva Real Red (Penedès),Torres,Red,Reserva Real,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Penedès, Catalonia, Spain",13.5%,$150,92,Michael Schachner,"Miguel Torres is aiming high with this heavyweight single-vineyard Cabernet that was bottled back in 2000. The bouquet is classy and deep, with sweet rubber, licorice and berry notes. Cassis, blackberry and chocolate compete on the palate, while the finish is much like flourless chocolate cake and a cup of espresso rolled into one. Clearly the class of the Torres Cabernets."
Stephen Vincent 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),Stephen Vincent,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Lake County, Lake County, California, US",14.2%,$12,85,Virginie Boone,"A perfectly simple, stainless-steel fermented Lake County SB with tangy lemon and lime notes, subtle at first. The finish falls off fast."
Mountain View 2006 Chardonnay (Monterey County),Mountain View,White,,Chardonnay,"Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$8,83,,"Ripe and sweet in apricot, pear, coconut macaroon, vanilla and Asian spice flavors, this Chard benefits from crisp acidity. It's not really dry, but has many interesting tastes."
Gallo Signature Series 2017 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Gallo Signature Series,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.9%,$60,91,Matt Kettmann,"Primarily from the Gallo family's Olson Ranch, with 8% of the fruit sourced from Sleepy Hollow Vineyard, this voluptuous expression starts with inviting aromas of red cherry and vanilla that are cut by slate, soil and forest herbs. The hedonistic palate is oak-driven, offering vanilla, caramel and smoke flavors that wrap around the black cherry and cola core."
Côte Bonneville 2016 Estate Bottled DuBrul Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),Côte Bonneville,White,Estate Bottled DuBrul Vineyard,Riesling,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$22,90,Sean P. Sullivan,"Single vineyard Rieslings are a relative rarity in the state. This one brings aromas of lime zest, citrus, white peach and apricot. It drinks off dry, leaning a bit sweeter but with well-balanced acidity along with plentiful peach and orange flavors. Apple notes persist on the finish. The sense of balance is impressive."
Doña Paula 2003 Los Cardos Chardonnay (Luján de Cuyo),Doña Paula,White,Los Cardos,Chardonnay,"Luján de Cuyo, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$10,86,Michael Schachner,"Smooth and round on the nose, with aromas of melon and honey.

The wine seems past its prime already."

There is compelling grip to the sip, where wet gravel and lanolin touches meet with lemon-cream flavors."
D'Orta - De Conciliis 2012 Zero Aglianico (Paestum),D'Orta - De Conciliis,Red,Zero,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Paestum, Southern Italy, Italy",14.5%,,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"This Aglianico opens with aromas of underbrush, black-skinned fruit and baking spice. The dense palate delivers prune, dried black cherry and vanilla, while dusty, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2022."
Thomas Coyne 1996 Merlot (Sonoma County),Thomas Coyne,Red,,Merlot,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",,$21,91,,"From a small Livermore Valley producer; this wine might be difficult to find. But it'll be worth the effort for the blueberries, blackberries and cassis that leap from the glass. The mouthfeel is soft and silky; the structure is tight enough for long-term storing. Should be fine until 2009."
Grayson 2013 Lot 10 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),Grayson,Red,Lot 10,Cabernet Sauvignon,"California, California Other, California, US",13.9%,$11,88,Jim Gordon,"This is a wonderful value and an attractively oaky wine with a good, grippy texture and lip-smacking fruit flavors. Full body and firm tannins give it a lot of muscle, and there's enough flavor concentration to last on the finish."
Maximin Grünhäuser 2015 Herrenberg Riesling (Mosel),Maximin Grünhäuser,White,Herrenberg,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",11.5%,$42,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Sunny tangerine acidity highlights the rounded, slightly creamy mouthfeel of this light-bodied dry Riesling. Bright grapefruit and quince flavors are forward and fresh, offset by stony mineral tones that linger on the finish. It's a delicate yet richly balanced wine to enjoy now though 2025."
Matias Wines 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Matias Wines,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",13.6%,$40,92,Matt Kettmann,"Dark and concentrated pomegranate and rosebud aromas meet with juniper and sweet pine needle on the nose of this bottling. The attack is a clean and flavorful, mixing dried cranberry and tangy cherry with thyme, marjoram and peppercorn, culminating in a camphor-like finish."
Alexana 2018 Fennwood Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yamhill-Carlton),Alexana,Red,Fennwood Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Yamhill-Carlton, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$65,92,Paul Gregutt,"This aromatic young wine opens with sniffs of blackberry and cola, and follows with plush flavors of the same, along with black cherry and a dusting of coffee. The palate offers a tangle of berries, a streak of cola, and textured tannins. Give it plenty of breathing time to open up through the finish."
Macchialupa 2006 Aglianico (Campania),Macchialupa,Red,,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Campania, Southern Italy, Italy",13%,$24,86,,"Here's an Aglianico from Campania with bright cherry flavors, almond nut nuances and lasting shadings of mineral and earth. It offers bright fruit in the mouth and a crisp but firm close."

The palate has a flat, creamy feel and stemmy, dry flavors of generic berry and bitterness. Too flat and devoid of fruit to rate higher."
Mandolin 2002 Syrah (Central Coast),Mandolin,Red,,,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",13.8%,$10,83,,"Harsh in texture, though there's some good cherry-berry fruit. The wine feels rustic and clumsy."
Castaño 2016 Alcaria Red (Yecla),Castaño,Red,Alcaria,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Yecla, Levante, Spain",14%,$12,89,Michael Schachner,"This blend of Monastrell, Syrah and Garnacha Tintorera feels lively, its dark plum and berry aromas laced with chocolate. Smacking tannins create a dry sensation, framing ripe black plum and prune flavors. Complex notes of spice and tomato emerge on the firm finish."
Teperberg 2013 Providence Red (Samson),Teperberg,Red,Providence,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Samson, Israel",15%,$90,92,Mike DeSimone,"This violet-colored wine has a bouquet of black currant and yellow bell pepper. It offers a nice balance of mellow tannins and integrated acidity, with flavors of blackberry, black cherry, pomegranate, violet and licorice that culminate on a surprisingly bright finish."
Quinta do Vesuvio 2007 Capela Vintage  (Port),Quinta do Vesuvio,Port/Sherry,Capela Vintage,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",,$125,95,Roger Voss,"From a parcel of old vines around the quinta chapel, this is a stunning wine. It has all the opulence we expect from Vesuvio, along with a density that is rare in this vintage. The tannins are there, but are equalled by the toffee, ripe fruit, figs, sweet chocolate. The whole wine is lightened by acidity, but will obviously age."
Starfield 2012 The Starbeam Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Starfield,Red,The Starbeam,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.8%,$65,88,Virginie Boone,"Soft in classic layers of cinnamon and clove, this wine is almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, with a wealth of black plum and blackberry constituting its inner soul.

Fattoria di Grignano 2012 Poggio Gualtieri Riserva  (Chianti Rufina),Fattoria di Grignano,Red,Poggio Gualtieri Riserva,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Rufina, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$25,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"This blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot boasts ripe black-skinned fruit and cedar aromas. The concentrated palate delivers smoke-laced black plum and tobacco flavors held together by firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2022."
Vincent Vineyards 2018 Family Reserve Malbec (Los Olivos District),Vincent Vineyards,Red,Family Reserve,Malbec,"Los Olivos District, Central Coast, California, US",15.1%,$40,93,Matt Kettmann,"The nose on this bottling exhibits a pure streak of black currant and blackberry, with purple-flower aromas as well as black soil and rock minerality. There is a solid and chalky tannic tension on the palate, where blackberry-jam flavors are lifted by anise."
Doyenne 2006 Aix Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Doyenne,Red,Aix Red,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$35,89,Paul Gregutt,"The Aix is two thirds Syrah and one third Cabernet Sauvignon, scented with mint and herb, with tart red fruit. The Syrah tastes of mineral and graphite rather than earth or cured meat, and the wine remains quite hard and tightly wound."
Castillo Labastida 2011 Crianza  (Rioja),Castillo Labastida,Red,Crianza,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$17,87,Michael Schachner,"Raspberry and plum aromas smell a bit powdery, like Kool-Aid. This feels wide, jammy, grabby and tannic, while flavors of currant, red plum and herbs end fresh and juicy, but also a bit scouring and rough. Drink through 2018."
Russiz Superiore 2016 Col Disôre White (Collio),Russiz Superiore,White,Col Disôre,White Blend,"Collio, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13.5%,$45,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of French oak, vanilla, toast and white orchard fruit waft out of the glass.

Pierre Morin 2014 Ovide  (Sancerre),Pierre Morin,White,Ovide,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sancerre, Loire Valley, France",13%,$25,93,Roger Voss,"Old vines planted in the 1950s by a neighbor named Ovide form this complex wine. Aged for eight months on lees, it is a concentrated wine, tight with acidity and with nutty flavors that add complexity and give the wine depth. This beautiful wine needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Tenuta Alzatura 2001 Uno di Quattro  (Sagrantino di Montefalco),Tenuta Alzatura,Red,Uno di Quattro,"Sagrantino, Italian Red","Sagrantino di Montefalco, Central Italy, Italy",13.5%,$45,87,,"From the Umbrian holding of Tuscany's Cecchi family, this wine opens with charred meat, leather, earth,  beets and an interesting mineral dimension. Aged 16 months in barrique, its aggressive tannins will need a few years of cellar aging to soften up. Drink after 2007. Imported by Banfi Vintners."
Cheval des Andes 2004 Red (Mendoza),Cheval des Andes,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$75,92,Michael Schachner,"Cheval des Andes brings together Cheval Blanc from St.-Emilion with Terrazas de los Andes, and for the past few years it has been the leader in Bordeaux-style wines from Argentina. The 2004 shows serious barrel notes framing classic aromas of aged gouda, saddle leather, mushroom and concentrated berries. The palate is structured, mildly tannic and layered with blackberry, cassis, raisin and licorice flavors. It's good now or will age nicely for another four to six years."
Lucia 2004 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Lucia,White,Garys' Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",,$45,91,,"Drinks young, crisp in acids and a little impertinent now, but with great charm; this wine is alive with vibrant cherry, mint and oak flavors that finish in a swirl of chocolate raspberry mousse. That makes it sound sweet, but it's bone dry, just enormously ripe in fruit. It's Santa Lucia Pinot in all its flamboyant glory. Drink soon."
Château Clerc Milon 2008 Barrel sample  (Pauillac),Château Clerc Milon,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France",,,92,Roger Voss,"91-93 Barrel sample. On the dry, structured side, a wine with huge fruit tannins that roll over the fruit. The concentration is palpable, all dense fruit. The berry flavors get a look-in right at the end. For long aging, as long as the tannins finally soften."
Terra Andina 2002 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Terra Andina,Red,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Maipo Valley, Chile",14%,$13,90,Michael Schachner,"Brilliant violet in color, with a lush nose featuring meaty black fruit and plenty of smooth French oak. Flavors of cassis and blackberry are true to form and rock solid, while firm tannins and proper acidity bolster the mouthfeel. A fine, tightly wound Cab at a great price."
Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2006 Syrah-Touriga Nacional Red (Ribatejano),Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima,Red,Syrah-Touriga Nacional,Portuguese Red,"Ribatejano, Portugal",13.5%,$22,89,Roger Voss,"Perfumed wine, deliciously aromatic but also structured. This is balanced, intently tannic. The fruit is equally important, the black currant juice and refreshing acidity a counterbalance to the tannins."
G. H. Mumm NV Cordon Rouge Brut  (Champagne),G. H. Mumm,Sparkling,Cordon Rouge Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$45,86,Joe Czerwinski,"The aromas are fresh and floral; combined with undertones of toast, they get this wine off to fast start.  The bead is fine and the mouthfeel creamy, but the solid flavors of tart citrus and green apple lack drama."
Contrade di Taurasi–Lonardo 2009 Coste  (Taurasi),Contrade di Taurasi–Lonardo,Red,Coste,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Taurasi, Southern Italy, Italy",14.5%,$70,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"This earthy Taurasi opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, blue flower, wet soil and leather. The ripe, structured palate doles out fleshy black cherry accented by cracked black pepper and balsamic herbs. With bracing tannins, give this time to fully develop depth and complexity; drink after 2019. Oliver McCrum, Polaner."
Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro 2011 Rosa Moscato (Delle Venezie),Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro,Dessert,Rosa,"Moscato, Muscat","Delle Venezie, Northeastern Italy, Italy",10.5%,$19,87,,"Light pink in color, with sweet overtones of honey and candied peach, this would pair with poppyseed cake or apple tart. The finish is thick and opulent."
Vinícola Miolo 2005 Lote 43 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Vale dos Vinhedos),Vinícola Miolo,Red,Lote 43,"Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot, Bordeaux-style Red Blend",,14%,$35,85,,"Taut, dense and ripe, this 50/50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with aromas of chocolate-covered cherries and cherry cordial. The palate is dry and concentrated with medium acidity and a tannin structure that calls for a knife and fork. Give it a few years."
John Anthony 2007 Church Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),John Anthony,Red,Church Vineyard,,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$46,93,,"The vineyard is in the Carneros, and the grapes from this great vintage must have been just about perfect, to judge by the wine. It's beautiful, rich and delicious, yet so finely balanced. Explodes in blackberry jam, cocoa puff and leather flavors, dusted with black pepper and finished with a swirl of toasted cedar wood. Drink now."
Stift Göttweig 2018 Ried Pfaffenberg Riesling (Kremstal),Stift Göttweig,White,Ried Pfaffenberg,Riesling,"Kremstal, Austria",13%,$60,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A tropical hint of mango flashes up on the nose before russet pear and tangerine take over. The palate brings a textured element to the rounded citrus fruit, like russet pear peel, that adds backbone. Tangerine freshness pervades a juicy, ripe but very refreshing palate. The finish is dry and mouthwatering."
Fattoria di Basciano 2016 I Pini Red (Colli della Toscana Centrale),Fattoria di Basciano,Red,I Pini,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Colli della Toscana Centrale, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$30,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with aromas of tilled soil, cedar and a hint of dark-skinned fruit.

Domaine du Cellier Aux Moines 2018 Beauregard Premier Cru  (Santenay),Domaine du Cellier Aux Moines,White,Beauregard Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Santenay, Burgundy, France",13%,$90,91,Roger Voss,"This wine comes from a 0.6-acre parcel of one of the top Santenay vineyards. With its generous, warm character, the wine is rich, the vanilla a reminder that it was wood aged. Baked apples and a mineral texture combine in a wine that will age further. Drink from 2022."
Castello di Verrazzano 2012 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Castello di Verrazzano,Red,Riserva,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$40,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Fragrant blue flower, plum and a whiff of mocha slowly emanate from the glass. The taut, savory palate presents Morello cherry, black raspberry, licorice and clove, while polished tannins and fresh acidity provide balance and structure. Drink through 2022."
Château Famaey 2018 Prestige  (Cahors),Château Famaey,Red,Prestige,Malbec,"Cahors, Southwest France, France",14.5%,$18,90,Roger Voss,"The firm tannins of rich Malbec shine in this wine, which conveys a sense of power as well as great concentration.

Bodegas LAN 1996 Edición Limitada Reserva  (Rioja),Bodegas LAN,Red,Edición Limitada Reserva,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",,$39,86,Michael Schachner,"Some Russian oak was used on this wine, which is 80% Tempranillo, and it has a nose of bell pepper and dill that could stem from that. The body, however, is good as is the acidity, but the flavor profile comes up midland. From the older school and Bodegas LAN, and in essence lost in space."
Vignobles Pelvillain 2016 Château de Cénac Grande Réserve  (Cahors),Vignobles Pelvillain,Red,Château de Cénac Grande Réserve,Malbec,"Cahors, Southwest France, France",14%,$35,92,Roger Voss,"A selection in the vineyard is the basis of this powerful wine.

Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2018 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),Bodega Volcanes de Chile,White,Reserva,Sauvignon Blanc,"Leyda Valley, Chile",12.5%,$14,83,Michael Schachner,"A light color and vegetal aromas akin to canned peas open this lean SB. Saucy, savory flavors of lime and white-wine vinegar finish short and hollow."
Dante Irurtia 2000 Reserva del Virrey Tannat (Uruguay),Dante Irurtia,Red,Reserva del Virrey,"Tannat, Other Red",,13.5%,$18,80,Michael Schachner,"The rubber and tree bark are common for Uruguayan Tannat. Flavors of dark cherry, cola and coffee are the best part of yet another tough, rugged power pack that's neither plush nor all that pleasant to drink. Hard as heck in the mouth; rough stuff on the whole."
A to Z 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon),A to Z,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",13.5%,,88,Paul Gregutt,"Quite possibly this has the largest production of any single Oregon Pinot Noir, which makes the quality even more impressive. A bit in the vein of a Beaujolais, this offers Gamay-like flavors of red berry and wild cherry. It's broadly fruity and forward on the palate, with zippy acidity that punches through the finish."
Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Clos de Marconnets Premier Cru  (Beaune),Chanson Père et Fils,Red,Clos de Marconnets Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Beaune, Burgundy, France",13%,$72,92,Roger Voss,"Ripe, jammy fruitiness gives this wine a generous feel.

Château La Garricq 2011  Moulis-en-Médoc,Château La Garricq,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Moulis-en-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",13%,$50,90,Roger Voss,"From an eight-acre vineyard, this is produced by the same team as Château Paloumey. Powerful and concentrated, it is also elegant, balancing its structure with good berry fruits and acidity. The tannins are still considerable, so drink from 2017."
Ferrari-Carano 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Ferrari-Carano,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$34,87,Virginie Boone,"Chewy tannin and oak with a smoky toasty component lead the way to a robust and softly rich wine that includes 21% Syrah, the whole aged in French, Eastern European and American oak.

Exotic and well integrated, it shows a lovely mix of pear, mango and peach that finds vibrancy through a backbone of balanced acidity."
Jorian Hill 2007 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),Jorian Hill,Red,,,"Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.8%,$24,87,,"Good and dry, with very soft, refined tannins and complex flavors. Suffers a bit from arch acidity, but a nice steak should balance it. The delicious flavors include blackberry and cherry jam, licorice, charred meat and a hefty dose of freshly crushed black pepper."
Kerloo 2015 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (WA)),Kerloo,White,Celilo Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Columbia Gorge (WA), Washington Other, Washington, US",12.2%,$48,89,Sean P. Sullivan,"The winery's first release of this variety offers aromas of apple, chamomile, spice and lees. On the palate, the green-apple acids are tart and bracing, needing some food to tame them."
Ryan Patrick 2001 Rock Island Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Ryan Patrick,Red,Rock Island Red,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$15,87,Paul Gregutt,"A blend of 56% Merlot, 42% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Cab Franc, nicely crafted and eminently quaffable. Light spice, hints of pepper and herb, and very pretty fruit tell the story."
Montemar Wines 2012 Watch Hill Vineyard EBA Syrah (Santa Barbara County),Montemar Wines,Red,Watch Hill Vineyard EBA,,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$40,89,Matt Kettmann,"Fresh aromas of dark violets, sweet lavender, elderberry and a light teriyaki glaze show on the nose of this extra barrel-aged bottling. It's medium bodied on the palate, where dark fruits meet with elderflower and more purple flowers. It's still a bit reserved."
Château Latour-Martillac 2014 Barrel Sample  (Pessac-Léognan),Château Latour-Martillac,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,,87,Roger Voss,"86–88.

Half the oak barrels it was aged in were new."
Campolargo 2009 Vinha do Putto Red (Bairrada),Campolargo,Red,Vinha do Putto,Portuguese Red,"Bairrada, Portugal",14%,$9,90,Roger Voss,"A new brand from Campolargo, this is firmly tannic, and it shows off the Baga grape. It needs several years of aging."

Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",13.04%,$50,91,Matt Kettmann,"Lemon preserves on toast, wet stone and early spring flowers show on the nose of this bottling.

The palate features lively lemon notes on a very slender, brisk and fresh palate, along with a tiny bit of spritz. It shows a depth of fruit: a wine for lovers of subtlety. The crisp apple-peel finish is totally moreish."
On Point 2014 Christina's Cuvée Pinot Noir (North Coast),On Point,Red,Christina's Cuvée,Pinot Noir,"North Coast, North Coast, California, US",14.1%,$38,90,Jim Gordon,"Full bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture. Having spent 15 months in French oak before bottling, it tastes a bit dense and muted at this point, and should be best after 2018."
Lis Neris 2008 Jurosa Chardonnay (Friuli Isonzo),Lis Neris,White,Jurosa,Chardonnay,"Friuli Isonzo, Northeastern Italy, Italy",14.5%,$28,89,,Jurosa is a beautifully rich and creamy expression of Chardonnay that shows the yellow flower and drying mineral characteristics that are unique to the Friuli winemaking area in northeast Italy.

MontGras 2005 Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),MontGras,White,Reserva,Chardonnay,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",14%,$10,87,Michael Schachner,"Snappy and nice, with a touch of mineral. Otherwise it's all about ripe apple and pear up front and citrus on the back palate and finish. Zesty and clean, with the mildest amount of honeyed sweetness. Imported by Palm Bay Imports."
Joseph Swan Vineyards 2013 Kent the Younger Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Joseph Swan Vineyards,White,Kent the Younger,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.3%,$38,94,Virginie Boone,"High in acidity and well-defined minerality, this wine is also soft and velvety, with a sensibility of crushed rocks and preserved lemon. From a younger block of the famed Ritchie Vineyard, it celebrates youthful playfulness on the palate, with a long-lasting, voluptuous finish."

Laker Sasha Vujacic presents aromas of cooked black plums, mission figs, black currants, uncrushed peppercorns and leather on this reserve bottling.

Icaria Creek 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Icaria Creek,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",12.8%,$45,87,,"Yes, 1997 is the current vintage. Reviewers gave this wine's bouquet two thumbs up—it has lovely aromas of wheat biscuit, mint and cassis. Our biggest gripe here was the wine's weight—which, for a Cabernet from a good vintage, was pretty light. Still, it had some pleasant cherry, red plum and earth flavors."
Lolonis 1999 Zinfandel (Redwood Valley),Lolonis,Red,,Zinfandel,"Redwood Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14.2%,$20,84,,"This appellation has some of the older Zin vines left, and those half-century specimens produced this baby. It has telltale briar and pepper flavors and is very dry, but is overly soft, with a medicinal, cough-mediciney finish. —S.H."
Rainer Wess 2018 Ried Loibenberg Riesling (Wachau),Rainer Wess,White,Ried Loibenberg,Riesling,"Wachau, Austria",13%,$45,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A yeasty touch still clings to the nose and gives a creamy aspect to the stone fruit scents on the nose. The palate continues this creamy-fruity theme but adds a wonderful green citrus zestiness that also provides a pithy, pleasantly bitter texture as a counterpoint to the generous, rounded fruit. The finish is dry and zesty and wonderfully aromatic."
Argillae 2017 Sinuoso Red (Umbria),Argillae,Red,Sinuoso,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Umbria, Central Italy, Italy",14%,$15,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Montepulciano, this opens with aromas of sunbaked earth, cassis and dark spice. The aromas carry over to the juicy, straightforward palate along with a hint of crushed sage and powdered tannins."
Durant 2015 Bishop Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),Durant,Red,Bishop,Pinot Noir,"Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.3%,$55,93,Paul Gregutt,"Made from Pommard clone vines planted in 1973 and 1984, this subtle and yet commanding wine fills the palate with lush strawberry jam flavors. It's smooth and textural, and time in barrel has imbued it with just the right touch of mocha."
Mazzei 2011 Belguardo Vermentino (Toscana),Mazzei,White,Belguardo,"Vermentino, Italian White","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13%,$17,88,,"The Mazzei brothers produce a Vermentino of depth, brightness and persistency. It delivers long-lasting flavors of citrus, peach and orange skin."
Jax 2014 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Jax,White,Dutton Ranch,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$42,90,Virginie Boone,"Winemaker Kirk Venge coaxes orange blossom perfume from this otherwise velvety, concentrated and youthful white, toasty in caramelized oak. The concentration makes way for a taste of baked apple and pear within a cradle of nuanced acidity."
Jean-Luc Colombo 2019 La Belle de Mai White (Saint-Péray),Jean-Luc Colombo,White,La Belle de Mai,Rhône-style White Blend,"Saint-Péray, Rhône Valley, France",14.5%,,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Fresh yellow apples and pears are dusted with hints of tangerine zest, allspice and honey in this plump, tea-tinged blend of 60% Roussanne and 40% Marsanne. Fermented and matured in oak barrels (10% new) it's a cream-textured white edged by twists of bitter walnut skin and orange-peel spice as well as lingering oak tannins. While heady in youth, it should meld nicely through 2029."
Bellangelo 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Bellangelo,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",13%,$19,84,Susan Kostrzewa,"Smoky, elegant and soft aromas of leather, pepper and berry lead into flavors of cherry and cigarbox spice on the palate of this approachable Cabernet. The wine is not terribly complex, but good structure and acidity give it cellaring potential, and paired with duck, lamb or beef dishes, it will make a very nice addition to the table."
Penfolds 2003 Bin 28 Kalimna Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),Penfolds,Red,Bin 28 Kalimna,,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",14.5%,,89,Joe Czerwinski,"This is a throwback to the Penfolds style of the past, with plenty of stuffing and tannin packed into a dark red wine. Chocolate and plum flavors pick up hints of eucalyptus and leathery notes on the firm finish. Drink 2008–2015."
Weibel Family 2019 Archgate Rose Pinot Noir Sparkling (California),Weibel Family,Sparkling,Archgate Rose Pinot Noir,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","California, California Other, California, US",11.5%,$16,88,Jim Gordon,"A finely beaded texture and rich mouthfeel are filled in with light cherry and plum notes in this well-balanced, polished wine. Freshness and softness are its hallmarks."
Nicolas Maillet 2008  Mâcon-Verze,Nicolas Maillet,White,,Chardonnay,"Mâcon-Verze, Burgundy, France",,$26,90,Roger Voss,"Good, creamy, caramel-and yellow fruit-flavored wine, finely balanced. The elements are all there, knit together, leaving honey and baked apple flavors to finish."
Francis Ford Coppola 2011 Votre Santé Chardonnay (California),Francis Ford Coppola,White,Votre Santé,Chardonnay,"California, California Other, California, US",13.5%,DrizlyVivino,85,,"A little thin, but it's nice and creamy, with buttered toast, pineapple, lime and vanilla flavors. There's a fine cut of acidity."
Frei Brothers 2009 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),Frei Brothers,White,Reserve,Sauvignon Blanc,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.9%,$17,85,,"Racy and bright, with high acidity framing dry flavors of lemons, limes and grapefruits. There's a green streak of gooseberry that signals some unripeness."
Martin Ranch 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Clara Valley),Martin Ranch,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Santa Clara Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.9%,$25,86,,"This valley is known as Silicon Valley, but before the suburbs overran the vineyards, it was one of the most famous sources of Cabernet in California. Although this wine is a little overripe, it shows the lost promise of the valley, in the beautiful tannins and overall balance."
Pask 2013 Gimblett Gravels Merlot (Hawke's Bay),Pask,Red,Gimblett Gravels,Merlot,"Hawke's Bay, New Zealand",13.5%,$16,89,Joe Czerwinski,"Some of the basic Merlots from Hawke's Bay—like this one—impress for their combination of quality and value. Cherries and dried spices pick up enough hints of earth and olive to be interesting sip after sip in this medium-bodied red that ends on a crisp, mouthwatering note."
Botalcura 2003 La Porfia Grand Reserve Carmenère (Curicó Valley),Botalcura,Red,La Porfia Grand Reserve,Carmenère,"Curicó Valley, Chile",,$20,85,,"From what may be Chile's trickiest grape to get just right, this is an admirable offering. Some of the variety's tomato leaf and herb notes are evident, but there's also plenty of plum and blackberry fruit to provide balance. Medium-bodied, framed by slightly rustic tannins on the finish."
Screenplay Wines 2009 Red (Napa Valley),Screenplay Wines,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$38,87,,"Blended from too many varieties to list, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Viognier, this red wine is acidic and dry. It has ripe cherry, currant and oak flavors that are very tannic, but the wine is not an ager. Drink up."
Most Wanted Winery 2008 Garcia Family Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (California),Most Wanted Winery,Red,Garcia Family Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"California, California Other, California, US",14.1%,$33,88,Virginie Boone,"This Cab opens with soy and molasses and then moves seamlessly into a mouthful of blackberry jam. Dense, it's still young but should develop well."
Estancia 2001 Meritage (Alexander Valley),Estancia,Red,,"Meritage, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$35,86,,"This Merlot-dominated blend is very soft and lush, with upfront chocolate fudge and black cherry flavors. It's an almost sweet wine, although it's basically dry and has good acids."
Qupé 2008 Nielson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),Qupé,Red,Nielson Vineyard,,"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.7%,$35,90,,"Very dry, fairly tannic and acidic, with a tart bite that makes the flavors even more austere than they are. But it's a complicated, interesting wine, obviously pedigreed. Shows discrete, elusive black cherry, crushed pepper, mineral and sandalwood flavors that linger. Should develop over the next 3–4 years."
Fess Parker 2011 Ashley's Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),Fess Parker,White,Ashley's,Chardonnay,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,DrizlyVivino,89,,"Despite the rich, buttery, toasty oak notes, this wine stands up to the barrel influence with its strong tropical fruit and pear flavors, as well as its brisk acidity and stony minerality. It's ready to drink now with rich fare like lobsters or scallops."
Boutari 2006 Kretikos Red (Crete),Boutari,Red,Kretikos,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Crete, Greece",13%,$15,84,Susan Kostrzewa,"The nose on this soft red smacks of black cherry and spice, and the like flavors are smooth. Tannins are firm but the wine has a light touch overall. The finish has a spicy spin. Pair with lighter poultry dishes."
Capay Valley 2011 Viognier (Capay Valley),Capay Valley,White,,Viognier,"Capay Valley, Central Valley, California, US",13.3%,$13,80,Virginie Boone,"There's a strong peach-fuzz aroma enveloping this wine. It's unoaked, tasting overly rich and oily."
Tre Monti 2011 Campo di Mezzo  (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore),Tre Monti,Red,Campo di Mezzo,Sangiovese,"Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore, Central Italy, Italy",13.5%,$14,87,,"Campo di Mezzo (Sangiovese from Central Italy) opens with a dark garnet color and bold aromas of black cherry, prune, plum and blackberry. It's definitely a very ripe expression of the variety with a touch of soft sweetness in the mouth."
Comtesse Thérèse 2003 Traditional Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),Comtesse Thérèse,Red,Traditional,Merlot,"North Fork of Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",13.5%,$18,82,,"Light-medium bodied, and smooth in the mouth, this wine would be fine if not for a strong brett presence, manifesting itself with strong horsey/metallic flavors and aromas. Underneath there is some decent red fruit, but it's too far under to rate higher."
Fattori 2015 Runcaris  (Soave),Fattori,White,Runcaris,"Garganega, Italian White","Soave, Veneto, Italy",12.5%,$13,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Round and ripe, this opens with fruity aromas of ripe apple and yellow stone fruit. The soft juicy palate delivers peach, pineapple and banana while a hint of mineral signals the finish."
Hafner Kosher 2002 Trockenbeerenauslese Barrique Chardonnay (Burgenland),Hafner Kosher,Dessert,Trockenbeerenauslese Barrique,Chardonnay,"Burgenland, Austria",10.5%,$25,92,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The headiness of roasted hazelnuts, Bourbon vanilla and blossom honey have an immense seductive power. The palate follows up with precision, concentration and long length. This oak-aged TBA is a mature, full package that will easily charm anyone—now or in years to come."
Staete Landt 2005 Chardonnay (Marlborough),Staete Landt,White,,Chardonnay,"Marlborough, New Zealand",14%,$26,86,Joe Czerwinski,"Tropical fruit flavors form the base of this wine, but over the ripe mango flavor rides a heavy layer of toasty oak, and it's questionable whether it will integrate before the fruit starts to fade. Drink now for its lusty obviousness."
Cascina Bongiovanni 2012  Barolo,Cascina Bongiovanni,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$50,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Oak, roasted coffee bean and star anise aromas lead the nose. On the palate, notes of fennel, licorice, mocha and espresso lend depth to a core of dried cherry while firmly delineated tannins provide the framework. Drink after 2020."
Chilensis 2014 Reserva Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Maule Valley),Chilensis,White,Reserva Estate Bottled,Chardonnay,"Maule Valley, Chile",13.5%,$10,85,Michael Schachner,"Straightforward apple and peach aromas announce your basic everyday quaffing Chardonnay: this is low on minerality and acidity, and thus it tastes of banana, melon and vanilla. A flat, melony finish lacks acidic framework."
Château Vincens 2016 Prestige  (Cahors),Château Vincens,Red,Prestige,"Malbec-Merlot, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Cahors, Southwest France, France",14.5%,$15,90,Roger Voss,"This ripe, wood-aged wine is full of rich tannins and generous black fruits. Its structure is young and firm, although the weight and opulence of the fruit will soon show through to give a generous wine that will still age. Drink from 2021."
Marqués del Puerto 2004 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),Marqués del Puerto,Red,Gran Reserva,"Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$50,92,Michael Schachner,"Mild rooty notes come side by side with plum, berry and cola aromas. This is deep, pure and elegant in the mouth, with ripe berry, spice and vanilla flavors doled out in proper amounts. A loamy finish with just enough acidic kick confirms the excellence of this gran reserva from a classic vintage. Drink through 2018."
Margerum 2014 Grenache Blanc (Santa Barbara County),Margerum,White,,"Grenache Blanc, Other White","Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",13.3%,$21,91,Matt Kettmann,"Very light in color, this wine has a brisk nose that shows Key lime peel, lemongrass, grapefruit blossom and a wet-concrete minerality. There is tremendous energy and zest on the palate, which is steely and stony with flavors of red grapefruit and a great textural grip."
Château de Bel 2014  Bordeaux Blanc,Château de Bel,White,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Bordeaux Blanc, Bordeaux, France",14%,$12,84,Roger Voss,"For a white Bordeaux, this is hugely rich and ripe. With its spice and toast, the wood-aging of the Muscadelle has added extra complexity. The alcohol gives the wine a peppery character that is less attractive while also removing freshness. Consider this wine a curiosity."
Etude 2012 Temblor Vineyard Grace Benoist Ranch Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros),Etude,Red,Temblor Vineyard Grace Benoist Ranch Estate Grown,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.3%,$60,92,Virginie Boone,"Estate owned, Temblor is a sloped vineyard influenced by the Petaluma Gap and its early-morning fog, planted to two types of Dijon clones. Oaky and round, this wine offers a flavor of steeped red-berry cobbler, with rich layers of managed tannin and a smoky finish."
Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Les Cailles Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Bouchard Père & Fils,Red,Les Cailles Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Nuits-St.-Georges, Burgundy, France",,$115,91,Roger Voss,"With smoky aromas, this starts out as an enticing wine. On the palate, the fruit is surprisingly soft for a Nuits-St-Georges, with the wine's evident structure showing an open character, edged with wood and red plum and currant flavors. The dry tannins give shape, but do not dominate this big wine."
Migration 2014 Drum Canyon Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Migration,Red,Drum Canyon,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",13.9%,$68,88,Matt Kettmann,"Quite reserved in aroma, this bottling from Duckhorn made with fruit from a Dierberg-owned site shows light cranberry and chaparral scents on the nose. The palate is straight-forward with tangy cranberry and cedar flavors."
Col Solare 2010 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Col Solare,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$70,91,Sean P. Sullivan,"Made from 90% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec sprinkled in, this wine starts out quite reticent, with notes of scorched earth, mocha, herbs, woodspice and cherry. It's full bodied and very tightly wound at present, with firm, chalky tannins that need significant time in the cellar to stretch their legs. Best after 2018."
Quinta de la Rosa 2019 La Rosa Branco White (Douro),Quinta de la Rosa,White,La Rosa Branco,Portuguese White,"Douro, Portugal",13%,$15,88,Roger Voss,"A blend of four typical white Douro grapes, this wine is cool and collected with fine apple acidity and a bright texture. There is a hint of yellow fruits to add richness to the aftertaste. Drink now."
Bianca Vigna 2020 Rosa Brut  (Prosecco),Bianca Vigna,Sparkling,Rosa Brut,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Prosecco, Veneto, Italy",11.5%,,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Fun and refreshing, this delightful sparkler has delicate aromas suggesting red berries and white spring flowers. The dry, tangy palate offers pomegranate, citrus zest and white peach alongside bright acidity."
Château Kalon Nodoz 2014  Côtes de Bourg,Château Kalon Nodoz,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Côtes de Bourg, Bordeaux, France",13%,$10,84,Roger Voss,The wine has layers of acidity that come from the underripe fruit. It has bell pepper and spice along with red currant fruitiness.
Château Clément-Pichon 2018 Cru Bourgeois  (Haut-Médoc),Château Clément-Pichon,Red,Cru Bourgeois,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Haut-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",13%,$26,91,Roger Voss,"Under the same ownership as Château la Dominique in Saint-Émilion, this estate has produced a ripe, Merlot-dominated wine. Although the fruit is intense, this wine has poise and clarity, giving some lightness. It will be worth waiting for this wine until 2024."
Gérard Bertrand 2015 Château La Sauvageonne Volcanic Rosé (Coteaux du Languedoc),Gérard Bertrand,Rose,Château La Sauvageonne Volcanic,Rosé,"Coteaux du Languedoc, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",13.5%,$25,90,Lauren Buzzeo,"A blend of 50% Grenache, 30% Cinsault and 20% Syrah, this is a refreshing and well-balanced rosé. Though young and still somewhat tight right now, it offers bright notes of red cherry, strawberry hull and plum skin that are framed by hints of orange blossom, citrus peel and sweet spice. Silky in texture, with a mineral streak and ample acidity that results in a bright finish."
San Simeon 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),San Simeon,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$25,84,,"At more than four years of age, this Cabernet is as good as it will ever be. It's sharp in acids and a little green, but offers satisfying berry, cherry and oak flavors."
Stephen Vincent 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),Stephen Vincent,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"California, California Other, California, US",13.8%,$12,86,Jim Gordon,This medium-bodied wine shows good red- and black-cherry flavors under a veneer of maple and vanilla-scented oak. It's well made in a popular style that many people like.
Château Carbonnieux 2018 Barrel Sample  (Pessac-Léognan),Château Carbonnieux,White,Barrel Sample,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,,94,Roger Voss,"93–95. Barrel Sample. The wine already has a delicious side that is both refreshing and tangy. Its tight texture is bright, shining with herbs and crisp fruitiness. It exudes freshness on the finish."
Pomar Junction 2009 Syrah (Paso Robles),Pomar Junction,Red,,,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15.5%,$36,82,,"Sharp and aggressive in acidity and unripe tannins, with a green mint edge to the cherries and raspberries, which actually are quite sweet. It's an unbalanced, rustic wine with excessively high alcohol."
Fitz-Ritter 2018 Dürkheim Ortswein Gewürztraminer (Pfalz),Fitz-Ritter,White,Dürkheim Ortswein,Gewürztraminer,"Pfalz, Germany",13%,$23,87,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Candied orange peel, lychee and rose petals perfume this classically aromatic but dry-style Gewürztraminer. It's a refreshing, easy-drinking white with a lingering bitter marmalade finish. Drink now through 2022."
Mission Estate 2011 Syrah (Hawke's Bay),Mission Estate,Red,,,"Hawke's Bay, New Zealand",12.5%,$18,87,Joe Czerwinski,"New Zealand's oldest winery (founded in 1851) has turned out a lightweight but wonderfully fragrant Syrah. Violets and cracked pepper notes are head-turning, followed by modest cherry fruit and a slightly lacking midpalate. Ready to drink now."
Tierra Roja 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Tierra Roja,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",14.8%,$155,94,Virginie Boone,"This is a well-made, small-production wine from the producer's home estate. Inviting in perfumed oak, pencil and cedar, it has brawny power that remains elegant in the glass, with persistent acidity and layers of cassis and cinnamon."
Pinord 2000 Pi del Nord Cabernet Sauvignon (Penedès),Pinord,Red,Pi del Nord,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Penedès, Catalonia, Spain",13.5%,$47,89,Michael Schachner,"A mature wine with its own set of proprietary virtues. Opens with cedar, cigar box and almost citric red-fruit aromas. The palate, however, is elegant, with herbal tobacco, raspberry and dry plum flavors. Finishes long and classy, with hints of the Old World and plenty of savoir faire. Drink now."
"Altura 1,024 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)","Altura 1,024",Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.9%,$10,84,Michael Schachner,"Leather and cassis aromas greet you, but airing turns them toward leafy and green. Flavors of cherry, raspberry and red currants are also a touch lean and green, but for the most part the wine shows verve and a good mouthfeel even if the flavors aren't perfect."
Weibel Family 2013 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),Weibel Family,Red,,Zinfandel,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",15%,$17,87,Jim Gordon,"Bright cherry and mellow menthol flavors dance on a smooth but firm texture of light tannins in this full-bodied wine. A cedary, minty character lasts into the finish."
Craggy Range 2006 Les Beaux Cailloux Gimblett Gravels Chardonnay (Hawke's Bay),Craggy Range,White,Les Beaux Cailloux Gimblett Gravels,Chardonnay,"Hawke's Bay, New Zealand",14%,$60,89,Joe Czerwinski,"A warm, lush style of Chardonnay, with ripe fruit notes of peach and melon framed by roasted nuts. It's on the full-bodied side of the spectrum, with acids that almost seem to fall away on the finish. Drink now."
Domaine Chanson 2019 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru  (Beaune),Domaine Chanson,White,Clos des Mouches Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Beaune, Burgundy, France",14%,$129,93,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whiffs of fresh-churned butter and honey introduce this powerfully ripe, sun-drenched Chardonnay. The fleshy, voluminous wine shows the heat of the 2019 vintage through concentrated flavors of Meyer lemon and Mirabelle plum. Matured in oak casks for 14 to 18 months (with some new oak), the opulent, spicy sip should drink at peak from 2024 to 2035."
Weszeli 2017 Belle Fleur Riesling (Niederösterreich),Weszeli,White,Belle Fleur,Riesling,"Niederösterreich, Austria",9%,$36,90,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Mirabelle plum, yellow pear and ripe apple combine into ripe fruitiness on the nose. A medium-sweet palate then puts all its cards on ripe, vivid apple flavors that are both rounded and fresh. The gentle sweetness is met with freshness and presents a slender, entirely apple- and citrus-scented wine that is not quite sweet enough for dessert. Cheese or chili-spiced dishes might be a better option."
Minassian-Young 2009 Estate Zinfandel (Paso Robles),Minassian-Young,Red,Estate,Zinfandel,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15.8%,$24,84,,"This is an enormously ripe, extracted red wine. It shows California's heat in the jammy raspberries, cherries and chocolate, as sweet and thick as the filling in a pie. Shows the strength of Paso Robles, which is ripeness, and its weaknesses, excessive alcohol, sweetness and a flabby structure."
Miguel Torres 2002 Maquehua Chardonnay (Curicó Valley),Miguel Torres,White,Maquehua,Chardonnay,"Curicó Valley, Chile",14%,$19,88,Michael Schachner,"Consistency is always a virtue, and once again this wine is creamy, fully oaked and more European in style than most Chilean Chardonnays. The nose is like popcorn, with apple and peach in the background. Flavors of banana, coconut, melon and apple carry the rich palate, while the finish is smooth and oaky. This is very good Chardonnay even if it lacks the extra elements required of a great wine. Drink now for its freshness."
Valle Martello 2015 Riserva  (Villamagna),Valle Martello,Red,Riserva,"Montepulciano, Italian Red","Villamagna, Central Italy, Italy",14.5%,$45,86,Alexander Peartree,"Very intense aromas of cocoa powder, milk chocolate and vanilla are thick on the nose, with chocolate-covered cherries and raspberries riding underneath. The full-bodied palate echoes the nose, with bold oak tones riding ahead of the lush fruit. Woody tannins rise up on the finish."
Château Talbot 2005 Barrel sample  (Saint-Julien),Château Talbot,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Julien, Bordeaux, France",,,94,Roger Voss,"93-95 Barrel sample. Huge black currant flavors, very ripe fruit, but also a great sense of balance, of proportion that give this wine both charm and impressiveness. It's going to age seriously, and well."
V. Sattui 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley),V. Sattui,Red,,Merlot,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$29,86,,"A little rough around the edges, but otherwise a soft, juicy wine for drinking now. It has pleasant cherry pie and ripe red-currant fruit flavors. Air it in a decanter or in the glass for an hour before drinking."
Pazo de Señorans 2005 Albariño (Rías Baixas),Pazo de Señorans,White,,Albariño,"Rías Baixas, Galicia, Spain",,$22,91,Michael Schachner,"A small portion of the wine went through malolactic fermentation, so it offers a lovely roundness. Features floral aromas backed by pure tangerine and nectarine flavors. Registers more fruity and smooth than mineral, with a perfect finish."
Locations NV CA 4 White (California),Locations,White,CA 4,White Blend,"California, California Other, California, US",14.5%,$20,92,Jim Gordon,"Lush and full in texture, this wine has more spicy flavors than fruity ones, as a blend of vanilla, hazelnut and cream coat the palate. It has the rich feel of barrel fermentation and will win friends with the layering of subtleties on such a decadent mouthfeel."
Cantina Novelli 2008  Montefalco Sagrantino,Cantina Novelli,Red,,"Sagrantino, Italian Red","Montefalco Sagrantino, Central Italy, Italy",14%,$40,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas suggest underbrush, oak, coconut, prune and dill. The concentrated palate offers steeped plum, dried blackberry, tobacco, cracked blackberry and licorice alongside firm, velvety tannins. It closes on a note of bitter prune."
Minos 2002 Vilana Vilana (Crete),Minos,White,Vilana,"Vilana, Other White","Crete, Greece",11.2%,$16,85,Joe Czerwinski,"Smells buttery and caramelly, then shows clean apple, pear and citrus fruit on the palate. Medium-weight, with a finish that turns more tropical, developing hints of pineapple, melon and citrus. Vilana is the grape variety."
DFJ Vinhos 2018 Aluado Reserva Alicante Bouschet (Lisboa),DFJ Vinhos,Red,Aluado Reserva,"Alicante Bouschet, Other Red","Lisboa, Portugal",13%,$19,90,Roger Voss,The deep color of Alicante Bouschet is very evident in this wine. Full tannins and powerful black-cherry and plum fruits are enhanced by touches of wood aging. The wine is still a little young and will be at its best from 2022.
Skeffington 2011 Vintage  (Port),Skeffington,Port/Sherry,Vintage,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,,93,Roger Voss,"Structured and, very firm, hinting at the black fruit potential. This solid, foursquare wine, is chunky but not without some elegance. The dry tannins come through strongly on the dense finish."
Bridlewood 2010 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),Bridlewood,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",14.2%,$20,86,,"This is a sound Pinot Noir, rich in raspberry jam, toast and vanilla flavors, with lots of zingy coastal acidity."
Santa Julia 2007 Viognier (Mendoza),Santa Julia,White,,Viognier,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$8,87,Michael Schachner,"Creamy peach and vanilla aromas are perfectly attractive, as is the palate. There's plenty of peach, mango and citrus pith flavors to make it worthy, and the finish is long and citrusy. Surprisingly good given the paltry price and Argentina's dearth of success with Viognier."
Fatty Pope 2015 Red (Paso Robles),Fatty Pope,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.9%,$20,88,Matt Kettmann,"Dark strawberry, black plum, fennel pollen, tarragon and a hint of caramel show on the nose of the solid second vintage for this memorably labeled bottle. Ripe purple fruit meets with minty spices on the palate, where the richness is cut by directed acidity."
Domaine Bellegarde 2016 La Pierre Blanche  (Jurançon Sec),Domaine Bellegarde,White,La Pierre Blanche,White Blend,"Jurançon Sec, Southwest France, France",14%,$30,91,Roger Voss,"Although it is dry, this wine is effectively a late harvest, with the grapes picked in early November. That gives the wine richness and concentration, offering ripe yellow fruits, rich acidity and spiciness. The wine is gently honeyed and lightly structured. Drink from 2019."
Cavatappi 2012 San Pietro Tuscan Style Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cavatappi,Red,San Pietro Tuscan Style,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.2%,$23,91,Sean P. Sullivan,"A blend of Sangiovese (38%), Merlot (31%) and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine displays each in turn with aromas and flavors of dried herbs, coffee, tobacco and cherry. The style is reserved, with plenty of fruit and acid but subtle oak—perfect for the dinner table."
My Story 2019 Chardonnay (Paso Robles),My Story,White,,Chardonnay,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",13.4%,$17,89,Matt Kettmann,"Aromas of lime blossom and Key lime pie meet with a chalky restraint on the nose of this bottling, whose label invites customers to write their names on the front. Flavors of wet stone and lime zest make for a delicate palate, where sharp acidity cuts into the finish."
Château d'Aydie 2010  Madiran,Château d'Aydie,Red,,"Tannat, Other Red","Madiran, Southwest France, France",14.5%,$26,94,Roger Voss,"This is a great wine, rounded and rich despite its power and weight.

Given 11 months in one-quarter new oak, it's the most open and accessible of the 2019s from Divio, and should be enjoyed through 2025."
Abacela 2000 Syrah (Umpqua Valley),Abacela,Red,,,"Umpqua Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",,$25,90,Paul Gregutt,"Abacela does best with its Tempranillo, Dolcetto and Syrah.

Ripe, forward, appealing and yet built for aging."
Knostman 2019 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),Knostman,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Umpqua Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",13%,$28,85,Paul Gregutt,"Fruity and forward, this opens with pomegranate fruit and ample but bitter phenolic flavors. The stemmy character frames the finish as the high-toned fruit fades."

Degani 2010 Cicilio  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),Degani,Red,Cicilio,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara, Italian Red","Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso, Veneto, Italy",14%,$20,87,,"Tightly layered and opulent, this has loads of fruit intensity, with notes of spice and moist earth. The palate shows firm density and supple smoothness."
Taylor Fladgate NV 325 Anniversary  (Port),Taylor Fladgate,Port/Sherry,325 Anniversary,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,$40,97,Roger Voss,"This is a superb blend of aged tawny Ports, blended to celebrate the company's 325th anniversary. Filled with rich fruit, it has great depth and spicy richness although it is also impressively fresh. Dried fruits and red plums are lifted with a hint of smoky wood and good acidity. Like any tawny Port, it is ready to drink."

Portugal Ramos,Red,Loios,Portuguese Red,"Alentejano, Portugal",14%,$9,87,Roger Voss,"Named after the monks of the Lóios monastery (now a pousada), this is a very accessible wine: ripe and soft.

This smells more like Sauvignon Blanc than Chardonnay, and the palate is racy and citric as well. Lime, nettle and tangerine flavors finish green, tart and long, with acidic push."
Peachy Canyon 2011 Mustang Springs Zinfandel (Paso Robles),Peachy Canyon,Red,Mustang Springs,Zinfandel,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15%,$38,88,,"Made in the Peachy Canyon style of great power and ripeness, this is one of the more assertive Zinfandels out there.

Iijima,"Whiffs of orange blossoms add delicate floral flair to sweet marmalade and honey tones on this penetrating dessert Riesling. While creamy and sweet on the tongue, earthy mineral tones and piercing acidity add balance and structure. It's delicious now, but certainly an age-worthy wine that will develop gorgeously over the next two decades at least."
Sanctus 2008  Saint-Émilion,Sanctus,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,90,Roger Voss,"This has sweet-tasting, juicy fruit that is immediately appealing.

Sundance 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),Sundance,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Maule Valley, Chile",13%,$8,83,Michael Schachner,"Powdery and sweet smelling, with an acidic palate propelling pedestrian green apple, lime and orange flavors.

Big on the finish, it'll beautifully withstand a few more years on its own before opening, the acidity lively enough to keep flavors vibrant yet mellowed."
G 2005 Dehesa Gago  (Toro),G,Red,Dehesa Gago,"Tinta de Toro, Tempranillo","Toro, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$13,84,Michael Schachner,"From Telmo Rodriguez, this Toro is full of eraser, violet and other candied, floral aromas. The palate, meanwhile, is hard and rubbery, with tannins that are bullish and flavors that run dark to almost bitter. A big wine in need of some manners."
Château Turcaud 2018  Entre-Deux-Mers,Château Turcaud,White,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Entre-Deux-Mers, Bordeaux, France",13%,$17,90,Roger Voss,"This ripe, concentrated wine has a strong texture with a tangy, perfumed character.

Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista 2010 Cannubi  (Barolo),Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista,Red,Cannubi,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$43,94,Kerin O’Keefe,"Hailing from the heart of the historic Cannubi vineyard, this polished wine opens with notes of black fruit, violet, leather and baking spices. The palate offers black raspberry, crushed cherry, clove and vanilla alongside brisk acidity and firm tannins. It's already accessible but will improve over the next four to five years and then evolve gracefully for decades. Drink 2018–2038."
En Garde 2013 Olivet Court Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),En Garde,Red,Olivet Court,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$54,91,Virginie Boone,"This wine is made entirely from the Martini clone of the variety, a heritage clone that imparts a lovely perfume of raspberry and rose that's hard to resist.

Attilio Ghisolfi 2017 Bussia  (Barolo),Attilio Ghisolfi,Red,Bussia,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$54,94,Kerin O’Keefe,"A camphor-like aroma mingles with forest floor, blue flowers and botanical herbs. Elegantly structured, the full-bodied palate features ripe Morello cherry, strawberry compote, star anise and tobacco framed in firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2027–2032."
Château Bréhat 2012  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,Château Bréhat,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",,$18,87,Roger Voss,"While there are plenty of tannins, this Merlot/Cabernet Franc/Cabernet Sauvignon blend also has a delicious, fruity character. The fresh acidity of the vintage is right there, balanced by black currant fruits and a dry core. It is developing well, and will be drinkable from 2016."
Pali 2007 Boer Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone),Pali,Red,Boer Family Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Chalone, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$50,92,,"Beautifully rich and ripe in cherries, raspberries and sweet smoky cedar, this Pinot is fully drinkable now, although decanting will help. But it's also an ager. Shows a mushroomy dryness and herbal grounding that suggest improvement through 2013."
Château Pontac-Lynch 2008 Quintessence  (Margaux),Château Pontac-Lynch,Red,Quintessence,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",13%,,89,Roger Voss,"Perfumed with its new wood, not excessively as in the past but obviously. That gives the tannins an extra polish, smoothing the wine, leaving black currant fruit to shine through. Age for 4–8 years."
Enrique Foster 2009 Raleo Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza),Enrique Foster,Red,Raleo Estate Bottled,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,VivinoGary's Wine,84,Michael Schachner,"Stalky in scent, this is underwhelming on the nose. It feels adequate and solid, with basic raspberry, strawberry and spice flavors. Scratchy on the finish, with mild red-fruit flavors."
Foris 2010 Siskiyou Terrace Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley),Foris,Red,Siskiyou Terrace,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Rogue Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",13.9%,$20,85,Sean P. Sullivan,"A moderately aromatic wine that brings notes of cherry, plum and baking spices.

Dunham 2008 Trutina Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Dunham,Red,Trutina,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.1%,$26,92,Paul Gregutt,"A blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 42% Syrah and 16% Merlot, the 2008 Trutina has elevated itself beyond any previous vintage. Firm, chewy, tight and spicy, it's a fully integrated and complex wine. Cassis, earth, lead pencil, coffee grounds and a streak of iron keep the flavors piling on. This bottle tastes way more expensive than it actually is."
Monte dos Cabaços 2009 Margarida Alicante Bouschet (Alentejano),Monte dos Cabaços,Red,Margarida,"Alicante Bouschet, Other Red","Alentejano, Portugal",14.5%,,92,Roger Voss,"Often unsung, Alicante Bouschet forms the base for some of the Alentejo's top wines. With this mature and ripe wine, named after one of the owners, Cabaços has shown again the grape's quality. The wine is big, powerful with perfumed tannins, a celebration of the warmth of the region. It's not for further aging, drink now."
Sutcliffe 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon (Colorado),Sutcliffe,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Colorado, Colorado, US",14.5%,$36,88,Fiona Adams,"Rich pomegranate, blackberry and plum aromas are sprinkled with spicy pepper and tobacco.

Le Potazzine 2017  Rosso di Montalcino,Le Potazzine,Red,,Sangiovese,"Rosso di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$34,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Forest-berry, rose-petal and wild herb aromas delicately shape the nose. On the bright polished palate, sleek tannins seamlessly support juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry compote and star anise. Thanks to the high-altitude vineyards, this has energizing freshness for the hot vintage."
Furthermore 2014 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Furthermore,Red,Rosella's Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.4%,$55,94,Matt Kettmann,"Very pretty and precise on the nose, this bottling, which is quite delicate for the rich-leaning region, shows candied pomegranate, cinnamon spice, hibiscus and wet gravel on the nose. Wild strawberry and rhubarb flavors pop on the sip, alongside watermelon rind and a very rocky and tense minerality. There is tons of tannic and acidic depth."
Château Haut Dina 2015  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,Château Haut Dina,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",,$30,91,Roger Voss,"While this dense wine has plenty of firm tannins, it also has fine, ripe fruit. Rich blackberry flavors and smoky aromas dominate. Drink from 2020."
Il Macchione 2014  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Il Macchione,Red,,Sangiovese,"Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$36,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Balsamic aromas of camphor mingle with underbrush, leather and prune. The linear palate is rather evolved, suggesting dried cherry, game and a salty note accompanied by dusty, drying tannins and bright acidity."
Viña Pérez Cruz 2010 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Viña Pérez Cruz,Red,Reserva,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Maipo Valley, Chile",14%,,86,Michael Schachner,"This is a good but generic Chilean Cabernet, meaning it's a bit herbal and fiery, with eucalyptus on the nose. In the mouth, this is medium in intensity and modest in character. Flavors of herbal red berry, carob and dried leaves end with a touch of heat."
Travaglini 1997  Gattinara,Travaglini,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Gattinara, Piedmont, Italy",13%,$30,87,,"Made from the Nebbiolo grape, a ruby-colored agreeable wine with opening aromas of black cherries, chocolate and tar. In the mouth it's bone dry and delicate, with soft tannins, although the acidity is high enough to burn on the finish."
Vignerons de Bel Air 2011 Grande QV  (Coteaux Bourguignons),Vignerons de Bel Air,Red,Grande QV,Gamay,"Coteaux Bourguignons, Burgundy, France",12.5%,$11,87,Roger Voss,"Soft and lightly smoky, round and ripe, this wine has flavors of black currant and blueberry, plus a touch of wood and gentle acidity. Coteaux Bourguignons is the new appellation that replaces the rather derogatory-sounding Bourgogne Grand Ordinaire."
Viña Los Boldos 2015 Reserva Sanama Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley),Viña Los Boldos,Red,Reserva Sanama,Carmenère,"Cachapoal Valley, Chile",13.5%,$7,83,Michael Schachner,"This wine's unripe, stalky berry aromas smell of latex.

Succession 2019 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Succession,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.2%,$30,87,Sean P. Sullivan,"With fruit coming from Double D Vineyards just outside of the Lake Chelan appellation, the aromas are light and hard to tease out, with whiffs of herb. The palate is more giving, with medium-bodied, almost thick-feeling lemony flavors. It's hard to see exactly where it's all going, but there is promise."
Wente 2012 Riverbank Riesling (Arroyo Seco),Wente,White,Riverbank,Riesling,"Arroyo Seco, Central Coast, California, US",12%,$15,87,,"The acidity and fruit are the stars of this well-made Riesling. The wine is rich in citrus, honeysuckle, apricot and honey flavors that finish dry and clean."
Enkidu 2014 Tina Marie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Enkidu,Red,Tina Marie Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.9%,$52,90,Virginie Boone,"This small-production, vineyard-designate is impressive in dried cherry and raspberry layers of flavor, supported by integrated oak. Juicy and explosive on the palate, it offers a spicy forest-floor note that complements the fruit."
Wente 2006 Sonata Red (Livermore Valley),Wente,Red,Sonata,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Livermore Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.2%,$37,86,,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this red is soft and appealing in red and black currant, mocha, anise, cedar and smoky oak flavors.

Michelle,White,Cold Creek Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,VivinoWine.com,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"Aromas and flavors of vanilla, candlewax, custard and clarified butter are out front. Abundant peach notes follow. It seems a bit stylized but still has balance and appeal."
Carpineto 2003 Farnito Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana),Carpineto,Red,Farnito,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13%,$35,90,,"This pure expression of Cabernet Sauvignon from sunny Tuscany has done a good job of holding up to the heat of the vintage. The wine shows ripe aromas of blackberry, chocolate and spice but does not taste jammy or cooked. In fact, it strikes a very good balance between fruit and firmness."
Patz & Hall 2017 Jenkins Ranch Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Patz & Hall,Red,Jenkins Ranch,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$75,95,Virginie Boone,"A perennial standout in the producer's line-up of vineyard-designates, this wine is lovely, complex and textured. Black tea, forest floor, clove and rhubarb keep it savory and earthy in the glass, while robust and refined tannin, a length of white pepper are there at its finish."
Simonsig 1996 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),Simonsig,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",,$14,82,Michael Schachner,"Pepper—both black and green—dominate this wine from the aromatics through the palate and finish.

Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Roche Volcanique Riesling (Alsace),Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,White,Roche Volcanique,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13.5%,$55,94,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Something floral and stony appears on the nose, along with a hint of smoke and something uncompromising and hard. The palate then packs a real punch: the wine hits you like a bullet of concentrated freshness and citric verve. This is bundled and effective, delivering a hit of ripened freshness with its lemon-zest dominated, dry tanginess. The finish has something juicy and luscious and is absolutely dry and clean. Totally lip-smacking. Drink now through 2027."
Plaza de Mulas 2005 Chardonnay (Mendoza),Plaza de Mulas,White,,Chardonnay,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$8,84,Michael Schachner,"Peach, melon and other slightly sweet tropical aromas lead into green melon and citrus flavors. Medium-bodied and a bit chewy, with a light, uneven finish that pushes grapefruit and soda cracker."
Robert Young 2001 Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),Robert Young,White,,Chardonnay,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$35,92,,"This wine is finding its style, namely, ripe in tropical fruit, peach, pear and apple flavors, soft acids, lavish oak, plenty of lees and a full malolactic fermentation that helps make the texture buttery and creamy smooth. This year's fine effort is not as big as the magnificent '99, but is opulent and delicious."
Beringer 1998 Hayne Vineyard Petite Sirah (St. Helena),Beringer,Red,Hayne Vineyard,Petite Sirah,"St. Helena, Napa, California, US",,$35,82,,"A major disappointment from this fine producer and famous vineyard. Aims for Cabernet-style wine, with ripely extracted blackberry flavors, but struck tasters as too big and clumsy for balance. The oak is also overpowering, with huge charry wood tannins."
Château Saint Ahon 2017  Haut-Médoc,Château Saint Ahon,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Haut-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",12.5%,$23,88,Roger Voss,"This family-owned estate in the southern Médoc close to Bordeaux has made a classic wine. Black currants, some firm tannins and a sense of the freshness reflective of the vintage all come together in a structured wine that will be ready from 2022."
Cantina di Montalcino 2000 Villa di Corsano Red (Toscana),Cantina di Montalcino,White,Villa di Corsano,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$39,81,Michael Schachner,"A super Tuscan that's not, dare we say, super. The nose is fine but the palate is overly acidic and heavily slanted toward tart. Has the color and nose going for it, however the palate is discordantly sharp. Not pleasant on the tongue."
Boas Quintas 2018 Fonte do Ouro Dão Nobre White (Dão),Boas Quintas,White,Fonte do Ouro Dão Nobre,Portuguese White,"Dão, Portugal",13%,$75,90,Roger Voss,"A limited edition wine, now mature and with great acidity and white fruit balance.

It will be delicious, showing its delicate wood-aging flavors alongside the ripe yellow fruits. Balancing acidity is refreshing. Drink the wine from 2021."
Château des Tourtes 2015 Duo Blanc  (Bordeaux Blanc),Château des Tourtes,White,Duo Blanc,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Bordeaux Blanc, Bordeaux, France",12.5%,$12,85,Roger Voss,"The wine has mango aromas that set the scene for a tropical, richly fruity wine. Spice gives an extra frisson to this ripe wine. It has an exotic character that is unusual in this style of wine although it doesn't seem out of place or context. Drink now."
Le Solive 2006 Innovazione  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),Le Solive,White,Innovazione,"Vernaccia, Italian White","Vernaccia di San Gimignano, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,,86,,"This brilliant Vernaccia (with 10% Viognier) has a sweet, candy-like nose that recalls caramel and butterscotch but that also has fresh aromas of stone fruit and pear to give it dimension. It's fresh and thin in the mouth and would do a good job of cleansing your palate."
Finca la Celia 2016 Pioneer Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley),Finca la Celia,Red,Pioneer,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Uco Valley, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.5%,$14,84,Michael Schachner,"Gamy, foresty berry aromas lack purity but are not bad. A full, soupy mouthfeel is missing definition, while this tastes of roasted, herbal plum. Saucy, minty, green flavors control the finish."
Belle Vallée 2005 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Belle Vallée,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$22,86,Paul Gregutt,"This is the least expensive of Belle Vallée's current Pinot Noirs, and far and away the best value. It's bright and spicy, fragrant with sweet-smelling berries, cherries and grapes. Forward and fruity, it is a fine choice for sipping on the deck."
Frey-Sohler NV Blanc de Blancs Brut Pinot Blanc (Crémant d'Alsace),Frey-Sohler,Sparkling,Blanc de Blancs Brut,Pinot Blanc,"Crémant d'Alsace, Alsace, France",12%,$19,86,Roger Voss,"Crisp and apple centered wine, full of fruitiness and lively acidity.

Oak barrel aging adds notes of caramel and buttered toast. It's a deliciously dry wine, although a bit direct and obvious. Seems at its best now and for 3–4 years."
Failla 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Failla,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",13.9%,$34,92,,"With its spicy, wild berry and pine notes, this Pinot bears Failla's distinctive mark. It's a dry, complex and exotic young wine, brisk in acidity and wonderfully silky and elegant in the mouth. If you're into flavor identifiers, they're wild raspberries and cherries. Good price for a fine Failla wine. Best now and for the next six years."
Lachini 2012 Lachini Family Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),Lachini,Red,Lachini Family Estate,Pinot Noir,"Chehalem Mountains, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14%,$50,92,Paul Gregutt,"A deep rose color, this pretty wine seduces with sweet cherry and red plum fruit, rounded out with a dollop of cinnamon spice and buoyed with moderate acidity. Full, forward, flavorful and built for medium-term aging, this should be enjoyed now through 2020."
Adler Fels 2007 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Adler Fels,White,,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.4%,$15,83,,"A bit soft and dull, with oak-infused flavors of citrus fruits and peaches that show some bitterness on the finish."

Castle 2001 Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),Castle,Red,Estate,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",,$32,86,,"Despite its silky mouthfeel, there's a toughness to this wine. It's extracted, with jammy stone-fruit flavors, and an earthy edge of coffee and dried herbs. Offers a robust contrast to Castle's regular '01 Pinot."
Viña Vilano 2014 Legón Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),Viña Vilano,Red,Legón Crianza,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$23,90,Michael Schachner,"Spicy berry aromas come with a bell-pepper note. In the mouth, this wine is raw and somewhat abrasive. Plum and raspberry flavors are lightly herbal, while this is distinctly tannic, raw and tough on the finish. This quality wine begs for food."
Domaine de la Taille aux Loups NV Brut Tradition Chenin Blanc (Touraine),Domaine de la Taille aux Loups,Sparkling,Brut Tradition,Chenin Blanc,"Touraine, Loire Valley, France",12.5%,$25,89,Roger Voss,"The honeyed flavors of Chenin Blanc sing in this attractive wine with its lemon acidity and pure, clean texture. This bottling is ready to drink."
Seven Hills 1999 Klipsun Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Seven Hills,Red,Klipsun Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$30,90,Paul Gregutt,"Another fine Klipsun-designated wine, medium weight, tightly wound and hinting at depth. It's balanced and inviting, yet shows less of the terroir-driven mineral flavors than the Klipsun Merlot from this producer."
Gallo Family Vineyards NV Hearty Burgundy Red (California),Gallo Family Vineyards,Red,Hearty Burgundy,"Red Blends, Red Blends","California, California Other, California, US",12.5%,$9,87,,"This year marks the 50th birthday of Hearty Burgundy, one of the most famous wines in American history. It has always offered solid pleasure in a red, and still does. A blend of Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, it's dry, full-bodied and rich in cherry jam, licorice and black pepper flavors, subtly touched with smoky wood."
Forstreiter 2012 Schiefer Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),Forstreiter,White,Schiefer Reserve,Grüner Veltliner,"Kremstal, Austria",14%,$24,92,Roger Voss,"A strongly spicy, rich wine, this has great concentration and an intense, dense texture.There is weight with plenty of ripe tropical fruits to contrast pronounced black pepper and bitter almond character. It's still young, so don't drink before 2015. Screwcap."
Château du Cros 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,Château du Cros,White,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Bordeaux Blanc, Bordeaux, France",13%,$8,85,Roger Voss,"A crisp and taut wine, this is nervy and lively with attractive fruitiness.

Tandem 2013 Inmácula White (Navarra),Tandem,White,Inmácula,White Blend,"Navarra, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$16,87,Michael Schachner,"Dusty, leesy aromas of vanilla bean, banana and saline set up a snappy palate with flavors of citrus, papaya and nut skins. On the finish, this blend of Chardonnay and Viura offers easy flavors of papaya, melon and almond. Despite being barrel fermented, this is decidedly not oaky."
Château Fonplégade 2020 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),Château Fonplégade,Red,Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,94,Roger Voss,93–95. Barrel Sample.

Nisia 2017 Las Suertes Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda),Nisia,White,Las Suertes Old Vines,"Verdejo, Spanish White","Rueda, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$31,89,Michael Schachner,"Peach and nectarine aromas show a hint of barrel influence but not too much. A high-acid palate keeps this oak-aged Verdejo on the citric and tangy side, while flavors of lemon, underripe nectarine, vanilla and wood grain finish full, oily and salty, with leftover zesty acidity."
Casale dello Sparviero 2013  Chianti Classico,Casale dello Sparviero,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$16,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"This offers aromas of just-crushed grapes, a note of chopped thyme and a whiff of moist soil.

Résonance 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Résonance,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.1%,$45,92,Paul Gregutt,"This is the second release this year from Maison Louis Jadot's Oregon project—both wines are labeled Résonance, but this is the Willamette Valley cuvée, not the Résonance vineyard bottling. Some estate fruit is included, and it is a subtle and detailed wine, with pretty mulberry and pie-cherry fruit. Thirteen months in 20% new French oak adds light mocha highlights, and it is as smooth and refined as one might expect from master winemaker Jacques Lardière."
Sauvion 2019 Domaine du Cléray Chardonnay (Val de Loire),Sauvion,White,Domaine du Cléray,Chardonnay,"Val de Loire, Loire Valley, France",12.5%,$13,86,Roger Voss,This particularly crisp Chardonnay is bright and fruity. Fresh apple and strong lemon flavors show strongly. Drink now.
Danielle de l'Ansée 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine),Danielle de l'Ansée,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Touraine, Loire Valley, France",12.5%,,82,Roger Voss,"With its aromas of aftershave and its flavor of lychee, this is hardly a typical Sauvignon Blanc. It does have some green highlights, but the main flavors here are sweet and rich, finishing with red currant acidity."
Manuel Carvalho Martins 2016 Golpe Reserva White (Douro),Manuel Carvalho Martins,White,Golpe Reserva,Portuguese White,"Douro, Portugal",14%,$25,91,Roger Voss,The high-altitude vineyards in the Vale do Olmo give this wine a cool edge that lifts the generous creamy texture and the mango and spice flavors. There is a mineral edge to this fine dense wine with its rich backdrop. Drink this wine now.
Adriano Marco & Vittorio 2006 Basarin Riserva  (Barbaresco),Adriano Marco & Vittorio,Red,Basarin Riserva,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",,,91,,"Here's a taut, steady Barbaresco Riserva with a meaty, fleshy quality to the texture that is backed by ripe aromas of cherry and dried blackberry. Leather, spice and cola come in at the end and the wine delivers a long, flavorful finish."

Sullivan,"Ask Mike Januik what makes Washington Sauvignon Blanc so good and he gives a simple answer: the Sémillon. That's the case here, with the variety making up 20% of the wine and showing itself. Aromas of fig and spice are followed by textured flavors and a lingering finish."
Telmo Rodríguez 2005 Pago la Jara  (Toro),Telmo Rodríguez,Red,Pago la Jara,"Tinta de Toro, Tempranillo","Toro, Northern Spain, Spain",15%,$75,91,Michael Schachner,"There's no shortage of ripeness in this single-vineyard, somewhat hot and wild Toro. The nose is all spice, heat and simmering black fruit, and that's backed by a brooding, heaviy concentrated palate. Teetering on the precipice of overripe, this wine needs all the air and patience you can give it to muster elegance to match its power."
Laudun Chusclan 2019 Les Petites Parcelles de Dolia Red (Laudun),Laudun Chusclan,Red,Les Petites Parcelles de Dolia,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Laudun, Rhône Valley, France",14.5%,$16,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"This is a plummy, concentrated blend of Grenache, Syrah and Carignan. Full bodied and framed by fine-grained, chalky tannins, it balances ripe flavors of black-cherry compote and plums against an earthen, stony undertow. At peak now–2025."
Sobon Estate 2004 Rocky Top Zinfandel (Amador County),Sobon Estate,Red,Rocky Top,Zinfandel,"Amador County, Sierra Foothills, California, US",15.1%,$18,82,,"Tastes overripe and raisiny, with a Porty finish. It's not quite sweet and not quite dry, but falls awkwardly in the middle."

Extra bottle age has softened but not tamed its feral wildness. This is a potent and expressive wine that sets a new standard for Southern Oregon Dolcetto."
Montresor 2014 Campovalentino  (Lugana),Montresor,White,Campovalentino,"Turbiana, Italian White","Lugana, Lombardy, Italy",12.5%,$13,85,Kerin O’Keefe,Aromas of pressed white flower and a hint of stone fruit lead the nose.

Finishes a little short and without much spice."

Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.7%,$24,86,,"Oaky flavors of buttered toast and butterscotch dominate this simple Chardonnay. It has ripe flavors of pineapples, mangoes and peaches."

The bright straightforward palate offers dried red cherry, clove and a hint of espresso alongside lithe tannins."
Villa Gianna 2011 Innato Circeo White (Lazio),Villa Gianna,White,Innato Circeo,White Blend,"Lazio, Central Italy, Italy",14%,$16,85,,"From the Circeo appellation in Lazio (Central Italy), this blend of Trebbiano (50%), Malvasia and Chardonnay opens with sticky aromas of honey, ripe peach and candied apricot. The wine feels heavy and waxy in the mouth and could use an extra boost of acidity."
Arboleda 2001 Syrah (Colchagua Valley),Arboleda,Red,,,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",,$15,88,Michael Schachner,"Ripe, rich and rubbery, and seemingly just hitting its stride. The nose offers earth, tar and lots of magnetic black fruit. Flavors of plum, blackberry and sugar beet are sweet yet not candied, while the finish deals espresso, mocha and wood dust. A very good Chilean Syrah, but one that should be judged among its Chilean brethren."
Insatiable 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),Insatiable,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"California, California Other, California, US",13.5%,$9,87,Jim Gordon,"A beautifully fragrant but not overpowering oak aroma wafts up from the glass. The same sort of sophisticated spicy element joins in the flavors along with vivid black cherry notes supported by firm acidity, moderate tannins and medium body. It's built like a classic, but it costs much less."
Barton & Guestier 2004 Thomas Barton Reserve  (Margaux),Barton & Guestier,Red,Thomas Barton Reserve,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",,,85,Roger Voss,"An attractive, smoky wine, with soft fruits and some firm tannins.

Toa 2004 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Toa,Red,,,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",14%,$25,89,Joe Czerwinski,"A subsidiary label from Coriole, the Toa Shiraz is a sturdy, seemingly ageable red filled with plum and cassis fruit and garnished by a hint of vanilla. It's earthy and solid, with a layered finish. Drink 2008–2012."
Robert Craig 1999 Affinity Red (Napa Valley),Robert Craig,Red,Affinity,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.6%,$48,90,,"The panel agreed that Affinity is an excellent wine, but had very different reads on the wine's flavors and bouquet. Notes on the aromas range from fresh hay and cherry to grapes and watermelon rind; comments on palate flavors run the gamut from cherry liqueur and vanilla to fresh herb and blackberries. One to try for yourself, to be sure. 2,500 cases made; age 5–7 years."
Germano Ettore 2011 del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba  (Barolo),Germano Ettore,Red,del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",,$50,94,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of mature berry, menthol, licorice, cooking spice and a balsamic note lead the nose. The firm palate is still tightly wound but already offers wild cherry, white pepper, grilled herb, tobacco and anise. It's balanced and fresh, with ripe but youthfully bracing tannins. Drink after 2019."
Cowhorn 2013 Marsanne-Roussanne (Applegate Valley),Cowhorn,White,,"Marsanne-Roussanne, Rhône-style White Blend","Applegate Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",13.1%,$35,92,Sean P.

The concentrated palate then completes the vivid, intense picture with ripe lemon zestiness, crushed yarrow fragrance and a salty, yeasty core. A pithy, zesty texture is a fitting backdrop. Snappy freshness adds welcome tone."
Mosby 2004 Dolcetto (Santa Barbara County),Mosby,Red,,"Dolcetto, Italian Red","Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$18,84,,"Smells inviting, with a lush, drink-me cherry, blackberry and spice richness, but then turns harsh in the mouth, with high acidity and a dry herbal quality. Cheese, olive oil and beef will soften and sweeten it."
Lynch 2002 Lynch Knoll Vineyard Syrah (Spring Mountain District),Lynch,Red,Lynch Knoll Vineyard,,"Spring Mountain District, Napa, California, US",,$65,90,,"This Syrah aims high. It's dry, rich and full-bodied, with rich tannins and oak, and is fruity enough for the core of cassis to develop for several years. On the other hand, it has a sharp finish that may crack this wine up before the tannins fall out."
Chic Barcelona NV Brut Métode Tradicional Sparkling (Cava),Chic Barcelona,Sparkling,Brut Métode Tradicional,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Cava, Catalonia, Spain",11.5%,,86,Michael Schachner,"Bready white-fruit aromas are slightly briny, while this feels basic and quaffable.

It's tart and tangy, with flavors principally of grapefruit and lemon."
York Mountain Winery 2005 Chardonnay (Edna Valley),York Mountain Winery,White,,Chardonnay,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.6%,$16,84,,"The underlying wine here is so good in fruity flavor and zesty acidity, you have to wonder why the winery piled so much new oak on top. The Chard is dominated by caramel, vanilla cream and butterscotch."
Château Recougne 2018  Bordeaux Blanc,Château Recougne,White,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Bordeaux Blanc, Bordeaux, France",12.5%,$15,87,Roger Voss,"This wine is soft, with ripe white fruits that give it weight while keeping enough freshness.

This bottling from Camp 4 Vineyard shows fresh and dried strawberry and slightly sour plum on the nose with a touch clove and dried ginger. The palate offers cranberry and hibiscus with red licorice spice, presented with lively acidity."
Quinta Vale D. Maria NV Lote No 17 Reserva  (Port),Quinta Vale D. Maria,Port/Sherry,Lote No 17 Reserva,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,$16,90,Roger Voss,"While this is categorized as a somewhat lowly Reserva Port, it has much more to it. From its rich field-blend old vine origins, it proclaims richness, spice, dried fruits and the ability to age. Drink now, but it will be even better from 2021."
Robert Weil 2014 Kiedrick Turmburg Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau),Robert Weil,White,Kiedrick Turmburg Spätlese,Riesling,"Rheingau, Germany",8%,$92,94,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Sweet and savory go hand-in-hand in this intensely smoky, yet penetratingly fruity wine. It's a deeply mineral Spätlese, marked by dark, dusty streaks of slate, yet brimming with vibrant tangerine and peach flavors. A spike of electric acidity leads a long, long finish."
Santa Carolina 2011 Reserva de Familia Carmenère (Rapel Valley),Santa Carolina,Red,Reserva de Familia,Carmenère,"Rapel Valley, Chile",14.5%,$22,88,Michael Schachner,"Foresty aromas of olive, black fruit and cardamom are brusque but solid. The palate is compact, narrow and firm, with grabby tannins that are soluble. Flavors of forest floor, herbal berry and a slight bitterness end with an aftershock of herb, black olive and mint."
Pastoral 2013 The Woodlark Dineen Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),Pastoral,White,The Woodlark Dineen Vineyard,Riesling,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",9.8%,$11,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"A first release from this new winery from long-time winemaker Rob Owen, this brings an appealing aroma profile of lime, slate and white peach. It drinks off dry (20g/L residual sugar) with abundant stone-fruit flavors that show good depth and intensity."
Château Louis 2008  Saint-Émilion,Château Louis,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,90,Roger Voss,"Firm and solid, this has a new-wood smoothness underneath the dark tannins. It is concentrated and dense, and the blackberry and plum skin flavors provide a fruity, juicy aftertaste."
Domaine Chancelle 2014  Saumur-Champigny,Domaine Chancelle,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"Saumur-Champigny, Loire Valley, France",13.5%,$20,89,Roger Voss,"A year's maturation and wood aging have produced this smooth, rich wine. The tannins are integrated into the red fruits that burst out of the glass. Aromatic and spicy, the wine is still full of young fruitiness and will be better from late 2017."
Michael David 2015 Lust Zinfandel (Lodi),Michael David,Red,Lust,Zinfandel,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",15.5%,$59,92,Jim Gordon,"Lust is one of the seven deadly sins, and this tiny-production wine from Michael David is a fitting adjunct to the winery's Seven Deadly Zins offering. Spicy, perfumed oak aromas and equally spicy oak flavors accompany deep tones of black cherry and dark chocolate. The wine has a thick coating of tannins that helps support all the richness and elevated body."
Kilikanoon 2005 Covenant Shiraz (Clare Valley),Kilikanoon,Red,Covenant,,"Clare Valley, South Australia, Australia",15%,$40,92,Joe Czerwinski,"Like all of winemaker Kevin Mitchell's Shirazes, this is full-bodied and lushly textured. The point of difference here is the fruit character, which leans toward black olives and espresso, with just enough stewed fruit to provide cushioning. Finishes long and velvety, hinting at vanilla. Drink now–2012."
Ruby Cellars 2014 Merlot (Paso Robles),Ruby Cellars,Red,,Merlot,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15.7%,$30,86,Matt Kettmann,"Aromas of underripe elderberry, black currant, sweet smoke and chocolate cake make for an intriguing (if unfamiliar) nose on this bottling from a new producer in Atascadero.

Robert Stemmler 2000 Pinot Noir (Carneros),Robert Stemmler,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$38,90,,"Smoke, burnt toast and vanilla aromas are all indicative of a full-fledged barrel regimen, but that's O.K., because the raspberry fruit can handle it. This wine has near-perfect structure: The acidity is bracing but stops short of being sharp, while the tannins are firm but friendly. By the time winter rolls around, this should be just about ready."
Cortes de Cima 2011 Syrah (Alentejano),Cortes de Cima,Red,,,"Alentejano, Portugal",14%,$45,88,Roger Voss,"Cortes de Cima was one of the earliest producers of Syrah in Alentejo. The style is full of ripe fruit, structure and a fine juiciness. Touches of spice are a reminder of the natural flavors of the grape. With its tannins, it will age and can be drunk now– 2018."
Liberty School 2007 Cuvee Red (Central Coast),Liberty School,Red,Cuvee,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$12,87,,"Here's a Rhône blend that's full of life and zest.

Certainly one of the finest Viogniers produced anywhere in the Northwest, this extraordinarily aromatic wine showers the palate with luscious and tangy lemon, pineapple, Satsuma orange and pear fruit flavors. Then the spices pile on, lending an exotic twist to a lengthy midpalate, and leading into a lightly toasty finish."
Bonny Doon 2015 De Propio Gravitas White (North Coast),Bonny Doon,White,De Propio Gravitas,White Blend,"North Coast, North Coast, California, US",13.4%,$16,88,Matt Kettmann,"Clean and crisp aromas of Asian pear, lemongrass, honeysuckle, passion fruit and green plum show on the nose of this blend of 64% Sémillon and 36% Sauvignon Blanc.

The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind."
Le Petit Panier 2012 Chardonnay (Vin de France),Le Petit Panier,White,,Chardonnay,"Vin de France, France Other, France",13%,$12,84,Roger Voss,"Soft and ripe, this is Chardonnay at its simplest. It has melon and pear flavors, light acidity and a rounded texture. Drink this easy wine now."

J. Portugal Ramos 2008 Loios White (Alentejano),J. Portugal Ramos,White,Loios,Portuguese White,"Alentejano, Portugal",12.5%,$10,86,Roger Voss,"This partner of the red Loios is a finely crafted wine, smooth, ripe, with just the right amount of freshness. There are flavors of peaches, almonds, a touch of lime juice, coming together well into a wine to drink this summer."
Gigi Rosso 2013 Trecomuni  (Barolo),Gigi Rosso,Red,Trecomuni,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$54,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Iris, wild berry and a whiff of camphor aromas lead the nose. The tightly wound but straightforward palate offers raw sour cherry, cranberry, crushed herb and dark spice notes alongside bright acidity and assertive, rather grainy tannins. Drink after 2023."
Brophy Clark 2004 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),Brophy Clark,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$13,87,,"Here's another great Sauvignon that displays Santa Ynez's ripe flavors, crisp acidity and polished mouthfeel. Bursts with citrus, melon, fig and spearmint flavors, with a fancy veneer of new French oak. Finishes clean and a little sweet."
Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2004 Amethystos Fumé Sauvignon Blanc (Drama),Domaine Costa Lazaridi,White,Amethystos Fumé,Sauvignon Blanc,"Drama, Greece",12.5%,$16,88,,"Oak leads off the nose, then does most of the talking for this wine, with vanilla and toast notes throughout. Borders on too much oak, but some ripe white fruit shows through the toasty veneer, while time in the bottle has lent the wine an appealing creaminess."
00 Wines 2018 Richard Hermann Cuvée Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills),00 Wines,White,Richard Hermann Cuvée,Chardonnay,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.1%,$150,96,Paul Gregutt,"A single new French oak barrel was given the distinction of producing this reserve-level wine. It's very much in the style of the previous vintage: incredibly rich, palate-coating and creamily delicious. Details of apple cobbler, Key lime pie and cantaloupe come through, and despite the overall power of the components, they all remain in focus and in proportion. The lengthy finish adds toasted hazelnuts and a hint of butter brickle."
Golser Wein 2016 Una Sunny Zweigelt (Burgenland),Golser Wein,Red,Una Sunny,"Zweigelt, Other Red","Burgenland, Austria",12.5%,$12,88,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A wonderfully aromatic touch of cinnamon perfumes the black plum and ripe blueberry notes in this wine. The palate is light and crunchy. With its cinnamon and intense fruit notes and residual sweetness, it's charmingly reminiscent of blueberry pie."
Croix 2019 Floodgate Starscape Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Croix,Red,Floodgate Starscape Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$78,93,Virginie Boone,"A great depth of rich red cherry and plum lead to a brooding midpalate of full-bodied intensity and concentration, the wine well-integrated in terms of tannin and oak. Vanilla, baking spice and a note of cola close out the finish."
Domìni Veneti 2000  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Domìni Veneti,Red,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara, Italian Red","Amarone della Valpolicella Classico, Veneto, Italy",16%,,92,,"Beautiful density and color characterize this wine as do its layered notes of exotic spice, cardamom, curry and roasted nut. Plush, full red fruit and cherry build in intensity, especially on the palate, creating a rich wine with a firm backbone, smooth texture and dusty notes on the finish."
W. Gisselbrecht 2007 Riesling (Alsace),W. Gisselbrecht,White,,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12%,$15,87,,"The nose beguiles, with scents of vanilla, freshly baked bread and wet stones that give way to tones of lemon and apricot on the tongue. This wine is light-bodied and crisp, a good summer sipper. Drink up over the next year, perhaps with a piece of grilled fish."
Willowglen 2003 De Bortoli Wines Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia),Willowglen,Red,De Bortoli Wines,,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",13.5%,$9,84,,"Plum and oak flavors and aromas, from top to bottom. Good red wine, built for the masses. Three-quarters Shiraz, with Cab making up the remainder."
Left Coast 2016 Brut Rosé of Pinot Meunier Sparkling (Van Duzer Corridor),Left Coast,Sparkling,Brut Rosé of Pinot Meunier,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Van Duzer Corridor, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",12.1%,$55,92,Paul Gregutt,"This exceptional sparkler weaves together complex, nutty flavors in a snappy, sexy, delicious and irresistible style. Apples are the core (forgive the pun) fruit, but that's just the beginning. Buttered popcorn, toasted hazelnuts, lemon oil and citrus-rind components can be sniffed and savored. This is the sort of wine that should be bottled in a one liter size—a standard 750 disappears way too soon."
Nathalie Falmet NV Parcellaire ZH 302 Extra Brut Pinot Meunier (Champagne),Nathalie Falmet,Sparkling,Parcellaire ZH 302 Extra Brut,"Pinot Meunier, Other Red","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,,93,Roger Voss,"Pinot Meunier fermented in wood has produced a very dry wine, but one that almost has sweetness from the wood. That gives a marvelous balance of freshness with ripeness. This single-parcel wine with its baked-apple flavor is ready to drink."
Jordan 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Jordan,White,,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$29,90,,"Easy to drink, this has enough sophistication to pair with rich scallop, tuna and lobster dishes. It's dry, although there's a lot of sweetly ripe orange, apricot and buttercream flavors, as well as caramelized oak. Brisk acidity fortunately brings a crisp, balanced edge."
Davenport Cellars 2012 Snowflake Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Davenport Cellars,White,Snowflake,"Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon, White Blend","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.1%,$16,88,Paul Gregutt,"Three quarters Sauvignon Blanc and the remaining Sémillon, this young and fresh wine has vivid citrus and grapefruit flavors leaning toward a hint of fresh cut pear. This is clean, crisp and leesy, with bracing acidity."
Bodegas Valdemar 2004 Esencia Valdemar Rosé Garnacha (Rioja),Bodegas Valdemar,Rose,Esencia Valdemar Rosé,"Garnacha, Grenache","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",12.5%,$7,83,Michael Schachner,"Heavy aromas with soft, dense flavors of apple skin and black plum. Slightly reduced on the finish, but surprisingly sharp and scouring on the tongue. There's a lot of zest and acid for a wine with a meatier flavor profile."
Wild Diamond 2016 Dumb Luck Grenache (Lake County),Wild Diamond,Red,Dumb Luck,Grenache,"Lake County, Lake County, California, US",14.6%,$32,90,Jim Gordon,"Smooth and rich, this full-bodied, warm and generous wine blends very ripe plum and raisin flavors on a gentle, broad texture. The flavors are deep and lingering, so it's quite a mouthful."
Lakewood 2007 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),Lakewood,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",13.3%,$16,85,,"Well-crafted, showing good ripeness for chilly upstate New York. Flavors run to cherry pie filling and fresh strawberries, turning to rhubarb on the crisp finish. Drink before 2012."
Ramos-Pinto 2011 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),Ramos-Pinto,Port/Sherry,Late Bottled Vintage,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,,90,Roger Voss,"This wine is dry and firm, showing developing fruit under dark tannins. Big plum and berry flavors are ripe, juicy and fresh on the finish. Drink from 2019."
Chateau St. Jean 2002 Cinq Cepages Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),Chateau St. Jean,Red,Cinq Cepages,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",,$75,90,,"Aloof and tannic now. It's very dry, and those tannins lock in and cry out for something to melt them. It's best to decant this wine many hours in advance of drinking it, but it should develop well over the next eight to ten years."
Podere Guado al Melo 2007 Jassarte Red (Toscana),Podere Guado al Melo,Red,Jassarte,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13%,$32,88,,"Made with a blend of Mediterranean and Caucasian grape varieties, Jassarte shows a green note of medicinal herb with forest berry and bramble. The wine is tight, bright and nicely acidic on the close."
The Girls in the Vineyard 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills),The Girls in the Vineyard,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Red Hills, Lake County, California, US",14.4%,$22,88,Jim Gordon,"This is a full-bodied and moderately tannic wine, smelling smoky, minty and fruity. It tastes concentrated and feels firm and nicely tannic on the tongue. Not overly ripe, it doesn't scream for attention but will make a really nice bottle for dinner."
Coppo 2010  Barolo,Coppo,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",13.5%,$80,92,Kerin O’Keefe,"Underbrush, violet, wild berry, menthol and sweet pipe tobacco aromas lead the way on this vibrant wine. The sleek palate doles out juicy wild cherries, baking spices and crushed herbs, while fresh acidity and a network of polished tannins provide backup. Drink 2016–2025."
Domaine Foivos 2003 Stalactite  (Muscat of Kefallonian),Domaine Foivos,Dessert,Stalactite,Muscat,"Muscat of Kefallonian, Greece",15%,$30,87,Susan Kostrzewa,"This Muscat offers luscious honey, lemon and tropical fruit on the nose, with viscous waves of lemon, pineapple and warming spice on the palate. Not overly complex but certainly appealing. Pair with creamy cheeses and fruit."
Bouchaine 2006 Pinot Noir (Carneros),Bouchaine,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$30,85,,"Light in body, with flavors of cherries, cola, mint and peppery spices, this Pinot is dry and silky. It has a sharpness through the finish that suggests a bit of unripeness or stemminess."
Mia's Playground 2006 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Mia's Playground,White,,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$16,87,,"Shows the ripeness and oakiness that have characterized previous vintages, but considerably greater structure. The jammy pears and pineapples are there, but the wine isn't as sweet as last year, and is firmer in acidity. Good value for the price."
Tenuta Argentiera 2013 Poggio ai Ginepri Red (Bolgheri),Tenuta Argentiera,Rose,Poggio ai Ginepri,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Bolgheri, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this easygoing rosato doles out bright red cherry and pomegranate flavors alongside bright acidity. It's simple but well made."
Bougrier 2019 Pure Loire  (Rosé de Loire),Bougrier,Rose,Pure Loire,Rosé,"Rosé de Loire, Loire Valley, France",13%,$15,88,Roger Voss,"With Cabernet Franc in the blend, this dry rosé is structured and peppery, lifted by a youthful burst of acidity. Red fruits and freshness show at the end. Drink now."
Louis Bouillot NV Perle d'Aurore Rosé Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),Louis Bouillot,Sparkling,Perle d'Aurore Rosé Brut,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Crémant de Bourgogne, Burgundy, France",12%,$20,87,Roger Voss,"With its strawberry flavor and tight acidity, this is an attractive, clean sparkling wine. It has just the right balance between acidity and bright fruit, leaving a textured aftertaste."
Ferraton Père et Fils 2009 La Source  (Saint-Joseph),Ferraton Père et Fils,Red,La Source,,"Saint-Joseph, Rhône Valley, France",13%,$21,89,Joe Czerwinski,"Ripe black cherries with a hint of garrigue mark the nose of this attractively plump red from Ferraton. The fruit dominates, but there's just enough savory complexity to make it interesting, with a firm yet silky finish. Drink now–2017."
Adelsheim 2015 Nicholas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),Adelsheim,Red,Nicholas Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Chehalem Mountains, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,VivinoWine.com,88,Paul Gregutt,"This light wine does not reflect the ripeness of the vintage. The fruit flavors are thin, and what is most dominant are autumnal hints of bark, dried leaf and clean earth. Though aged 10 months in one-third new French oak, little barrel influence is evident in the flavors."
Beaulieu Vineyard 1997 Signet Collection Sangiovese (Napa Valley),Beaulieu Vineyard,Red,Signet Collection,Sangiovese,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13%,$20,87,,"Soft, generous, and fruity, with seductive sweet fruit flavors and silky tannins. A very typical North Coast style: smooth, light-bodied, with just a touch of oak in the background. Ripe, sweet, fruity and simple."
Balnaves of Coonawarra 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Coonawarra),Balnaves of Coonawarra,Red,,"Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Coonawarra, South Australia, Australia",13.5%,$28,91,Joe Czerwinski,"It's labeled Cabernet-Merlot, but the reality is that the Merlot content is less than 10%. Still, it must bring something positive to the blend, as this is more richly textured and lush than Balnaves' straight Cabernet Sauvignon. Dark aromas and flavors sing gracefully, offering hints of chocolate, anise, cassis, coffee and spice. Finishes long, with velvety tannins; drink now–2015, possibly longer."
Pelvillain Frères 2014 Zee Original Rosé (Côtes du Lot),Pelvillain Frères,Rose,Zee Original,Rosé,"Côtes du Lot, Southwest France, France",14%,$12,86,Roger Voss,"Bright pink in color, this is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has a light texture that supports the raspberry flavors. A delicate cut of acidity comes through at the end. Drink now."
Meyer-Fonné 2018 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace),Meyer-Fonné,White,Réserve,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13.5%,$26,90,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A touch of reduction still clings to the nose but underneath, ripe pear notes peek through. The palate of this wine is mellow, with a lovely edge of baking spice and a rounded mouthfeel and texture. Concentration becomes apparent on the dry, bright finish."
Paul O'Brien 2013 Reserva Tempranillo (Umpqua Valley),Paul O'Brien,Red,Reserva,Tempranillo,"Umpqua Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",13.5%,$60,89,Paul Gregutt,"The very limited reserve bottling sees two years of barrel age in 100% new French oak. In this vintage, there isn't quite enough fruit ripeness to match that treatment. The light elegant fruit flavors of pomegranate and wild berry are a bit overpowered by the darker smoky oak flavors. A stiff streak of espresso runs through the finish. Best to drink this now through 2020."
Rocche Costamagna 2017 Rocche dell'Annunziata  (Barolo),Rocche Costamagna,Red,Rocche dell'Annunziata,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.5%,$55,92,Kerin O’Keefe,"Inviting aromas of black-skinned berries, forest floor and leather lead the way. The polished, full-bodied palate offers blackberry jam, licorice and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2023–2029."
Te Awanga 2019 Wildsong Wildflower Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay),Te Awanga,White,Wildsong Wildflower Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,"Hawke's Bay, New Zealand",12.5%,$15,88,Christina Pickard,"This is a vibrant, aromatic Sauvignon from Hawkes Bay that leads with notes of bright passionfruit, grapefruit, lime blossom, flint and grass. It's tight and focused, with a crisp acidity, a chalky yet slippery texture and zingy, juicy fruit right to the finish."
Angerhof Tschida 2010 Trockenbeerenaulese Sämling (Burgenland),Angerhof Tschida,Dessert,Trockenbeerenaulese,"Sämling, Other White","Burgenland, Austria",8.5%,,94,Roger Voss,"A spice driven wine, full of ripe flavors, wild flower honey and intense acidity. This is a beautiful wine, its richness totally balanced by a fresher side. Age this wine for a long time. Drink from 2018."
Jean-Claude Boisset 2003  Bourgogne,Jean-Claude Boisset,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Bourgogne, Burgundy, France",,$16,84,,"This blend of Pinots from Aloxe-Corton, Chorey, Savigny and Marsannay is slightly lean and herbal. Has some nice black cherry fruit, then finishes on a teal-like note with some drying tannins. Try with rare beef or lamb."
Talosa 2015 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),Talosa,Red,Riserva,Sangiovese,"Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$43,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Mature black-skinned fruit, fragrant purple flower and French oak aromas waft out of the glass along with balsamic notes of eucalyptus. Firmly structured, the rather lean, austere palate features dried cherry, pomegranate, oak-driven spice and roasted coffee bean alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins that leave a drying finish."
Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2014 Bernkasteler alte Badstube am Doctorberg Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),Dr. Pauly Bergweiler,White,Bernkasteler alte Badstube am Doctorberg Spätlese,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",7.5%,$28,88,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Jolts of honey, lemon and lime introduce this animated Spätlese. It's forward and approachable with sunny tangerine and peach flavors, but maintains a nervous tension of acidity. The finish is brisk and tight."
Domaine du Père Caboche 2017 Vieilles Vignes Elizabeth Chambellan Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),Domaine du Père Caboche,Red,Vieilles Vignes Elizabeth Chambellan,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rhône Valley, France",15.5%,$60,93,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Plump but pure in fruit, this blend of 88% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 2% Mourvèdre highlights intensely ripe boysenberry jam and raspberry flavors. Matured in a combination of large-format oak, concrete and stainless steel, it's luminous primary fruit is appealing in youth but rigid, drying tannins should meld nicely over the next few years. At peak now–2030."
Washington Hills 2018 Dry Riesling (Washington),Washington Hills,White,Dry,Riesling,"Washington, Washington Other, Washington, US",12.15%,$11,86,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas offer notes of pear, lime, diesel and lime leaf, showing a bit of evolution. Just off-dry-drinking Nestea Lemon Iced tea flavors follow. The acid balances them out well."
Moshin 2012 Rosalina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Moshin,Red,Rosalina Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",12.6%,$55,87,Virginie Boone,"Cherry and clove star in this vineyard-designate from a good vintage, in which the producer again aims low in terms of ripeness. It makes for a somewhat one-dimensional experience once the initial aromas and bite of flavor dissipate on the palate."
Cupcake 2017 Butterkissed Chardonnay (California),Cupcake,White,Butterkissed,Chardonnay,"California, California Other, California, US",14%,$11,83,Jim Gordon,"A heavy, almost sweet and artificially spicy character makes this wine polarizing. It tastes extremely oaky, and thick and sticky on the palate."
Domaine les Ondines 2018 Red (Vacqueyras),Domaine les Ondines,Red,,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Vacqueyras, Rhône Valley, France",14.5%,$25,91,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Whiffs of sandalwood and violet lend a sultry perfume to ripe, ruddy black plums and cherries on this voluptuous red. In this mouthwatering blend of Grenache (75%), Cinsault (5%) and Syrah (20%), the palate is unctuously fruity but freshly balanced by streaks of red cassis acidity and a lingering granitic finish. Lovely already but should drink well through 2028."
Wakefield 2016 Estate Label Riesling (Clare Valley),Wakefield,White,Estate Label,Riesling,"Clare Valley, South Australia, Australia",12.5%,$18,90,Christina Pickard,"Pale gold in color, this wine leads with notes of fresh apples, blossoms and honeycomb. The palate is prickly and refreshing, with a good lick of acidity and some texture and weight to prop it up. Drink now."
Sojourn 2016 Oakville Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Sojourn,Red,Oakville Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$125,92,Virginie Boone,"This well-sourced red is sweetly rounded and rich in tobacco, cedar and sage, with secondary notes of dark cherry and dried herb. Robust and powerfully built, it has rounded tannins and nicely integrated oak."
Best's 2018 Pinot Noir (Great Western),Best's,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Great Western, Victoria, Australia",13%,$25,93,Christina Pickard,"From one of Australia's most treasured historic estates, located in the cool, remote Grampians region of western Victoria, this light, bright Pinot is the color of raspberry juice. Gorgeously perfumed, and seemingly fermented with a fair amount of whole-bunch fruit, it's like squeezing the juice from a fistful of wild, freshly picked strawberries and raspberries; stalks, stems, cinnamon and minerals along for the stroll. The palate is equally vibrant, like biting into those same fresh berries; the texture silky, strung with beads of stalky, spicy tannins."
Derby 2014 Sparkling Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),Derby,Sparkling,Sparkling,Pinot Noir,"San Luis Obispo County, Central Coast, California, US",12%,$54,88,Matt Kettmann,"There's a powerful effervescence on the nose of this bottling, starting with aromas of pink lemon, red plum and rose petal. The palate is tangy, with tight nectarine, tart red plum and a searing acidity."
Nuntia Vini 2005 Volvoreta Probus  (Toro),Nuntia Vini,Red,Volvoreta Probus,"Tinta de Toro, Tempranillo","Toro, Northern Spain, Spain",14.5%,$25,88,Michael Schachner,"Crushed floral aromas, berry-infused tea and cherry candy aromas give this wine a sweet profile. The palate, however, is anything but. It pounds with toasty black fruit, licorice and fiery menthol. The feel is a bit tannic but not terribly harsh, so maybe another three to five years will serve it well."
Waterbrook 2010 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Waterbrook,Red,,Merlot,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.2%,$12,87,Sean P. Sullivan,"This 100% varietal wine hails from Canyon Vineyard Ranch and Oasis vineyards. It's tart and puckering with notes of cocoa, raspberries and licorice and a firm squeeze of tannins. Barrel notes of vanilla and dill linger on the finish."
Woodbridge 1998 Chardonnay (California),Woodbridge,White,,Chardonnay,"California, California Other, California, US",,$8,85,,"Apple, melon and citrus aromas. Offers pretty citrus and apple flavors, and a spicy finish. Tastes like it has some small percentage of a fruity lesser varietal blended in. Still, it's about as good as California Chardonnay gets at this price. Best Buy."
Skinner 2016 Eighteen Sixty-One Red (El Dorado),Skinner,Red,Eighteen Sixty-One,Rhône-style Red Blend,"El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",14.4%,$32,92,Jim Gordon,"Intricately woven, complex flavors are braced by firm tannins and bright acidity in this Rhône-style red blend. It is full in body without being fat, blending earthy, meaty flavors with black pepper, blackberry and roasted plum for a subtle but compelling outcome."
Château La Joya 2000 Reserva Malbec (Colchagua Valley),Château La Joya,Red,Reserva,Malbec,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",,,84,Michael Schachner,"This is the winery's first-ever crack at Malbec, and the wine shows the grape's telltale blueberry and graham-cracker sweetness. But there's also some peanut and heavy earth in there, too, neither of which does much for what otherwise is a commendable wine."
Henri de Villamont 2009 Clos St-Jean Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),Henri de Villamont,White,Clos St-Jean Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Chassagne-Montrachet, Burgundy, France",,$65,91,Roger Voss,"This is aromatic, with ripeness that balances the bright green and white fruits. Wood and spice notes are followed by a touch of lemon jelly and minerally acidity. It's a wine that is still developing, waiting for the ripe fruit of the vintage to surface."
Global Wines 2013 Casa de Santar Reserva Red (Dão),Global Wines,Red,Casa de Santar Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Dão, Portugal",14%,$48,92,Roger Voss,"This is a strong statement of ripe, powerful fruit and dense tannins. So although the wine is now five-years-old, it still seems young. Its structure, from the rich Touriga Nacional that dominates the blend, is firm and a solid base for the black-currant fruits. Drink from 2019."
Sojourn 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Sojourn,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$39,88,,"A simple but by no means unattractive Pinot, dry and silky, with pleasant cola, cranberry and sandalwood flavors. Shows the sophistication of the winery's single-vineyard bottlings, minus the concentration."
Domaine du Salut 2019  Graves,Domaine du Salut,White,,,"Graves, Bordeaux, France",12.5%,$18,88,Roger Voss,"Fresh and with attractive perfumed fruit, this wine has a lift to it. Fresh citrus and white-apple flavors are enhanced by the wine's spiciness and crisp aftertaste. Drink from late 2021."
Rutz 2002 Burnside Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Rutz,Red,Burnside Vineyard Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$60,86,,"There's lots of ripe berry flavor in this Pinot, whose mouthfeel has a certain rustic character. It's a heavy wine, dark, thick and jammy, with a chocolaty feel to the cherries and rhubarb pie flavors, although it's completely dry."
Damiani 2007 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),Damiani,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12.8%,$23,85,,"Weighty yet crisp, with a bit more density than many of its neighbors, this Cabernet Franc offers up green pepper and spice flavors that rest on a carpet of soft tannins and a short, cherry-flavored finish. Try with roast pork in a fruit sauce. Drink now."
Anne & Marc Wassler 2018 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),Anne & Marc Wassler,White,,"Gewürztraminer, Gewürztraminer","Alsace, Alsace, France",14%,$25,88,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Passion fruit freshness fills the nose on this wine alongside honeysuckle notes. The palate comes in with rounded but balanced sweetness that emphasizes peachy fruit at the core, along with a pleasant, pithy texture. It is is medium dry and aromatic on the finish."
River Ford 1999 Saint Clair Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),River Ford,White,Saint Clair Estate,Sauvignon Blanc,"Marlborough, New Zealand",12.5%,$16,87,,"A very herbaceous nose and lean grapefruit and gooseberry flavor profile make this a fairly textbook rendition of this certain style of Sauvignon Blanc. The texture is quite crisp and the finish dry, with a pronounced lime quality. Very alive, and not a wine people will be ambivalent about."
Olivier Roten 2016 Symphonie Pinot Noir (Valais),Olivier Roten,Red,Symphonie,Pinot Noir,,13%,$38,92,Jeff Jenssen,"Crimson red in the glass, this Swiss Pinot Noir has delightful aromas of ripe red cherries and farm-fresh raspberries. It is well balanced and has delicate flavors of raspberry, saddle leather, black cherry and baking spice. It is velvety smooth, with persistent touches of nutmeg and cinnamon on the finish."
Ruffino 1999 Romitorio di Santedame Red (Toscana),Ruffino,Red,Romitorio di Santedame,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,,91,,"Solid and intense, the first vintage of this wine to hit U.S. shores is an auspicious start. It's lush and juicy, with a nose- and palate-caressing black cherry, mocha cream and chocolate profile. This Colorino-Merlot blend successfully pushes all the pleasure buttons while maintaining structure and showing substance. With a long, dry finish sporting soft ripe tannins, this is tempting now, but will be best from 2004–2010. Cellar Selection."
Case Paolin NV Brut  (Asolo Prosecco Superiore),Case Paolin,Sparkling,Brut,White Blend,"Asolo Prosecco Superiore, Veneto, Italy",11.5%,$20,92,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made with organic grapes, this gentle sparkler opens with aromas of hay and white stone fruit. The dry, creamy palate offers green apple, pear and fennel before a saline close. Bright acidity lifts the fruity flavors."
Domaine de Rosiers 2018 Coeur de Rose  (Côte Rôtie),Domaine de Rosiers,Red,Coeur de Rose,,"Côte Rôtie, Rhône Valley, France",13.5%,,95,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Sourced from the clay and iron-rich soils of the Côte Brune, there's a gorgeous mineral sheen that extends from nose to finish in this rich, penetrating Syrah (accented by 2% Viognier). Matured in 50% new oak, it's delicate in mouthfeel but sumptuous and concentrated in black plum and mulberry flavors. While seductive now for its vibrant, plummy flavors, it's a wine that should gain saltier, smokier nuances well through 2035."
Hauner 2012  Malvasia delle Lipari,Hauner,Dessert,,White Blend,"Malvasia delle Lipari, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13%,$30,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Here's a savory nectar made with late-harvested grapes—95% Malvasia delle Lipari and 5% Corinto Nero—that opens with aromas of dried stone fruit, nut and sweet spice. The palate doles out apricot, fig, hazelnut and a dollop of acacia honey while fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors and prevents it from being overly sweet."

The wine is pulsing with sweet fruit flavors and boasts thick, muscular density and high, but well integrated, alcohol."
Sunstone 2019 Mourvèdre (Santa Ynez Valley),Sunstone,Red,,Mourvèdre,"Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$45,88,Matt Kettmann,"There's a funky streak to the nose of this bottling, starting with aromas of pomegranate, baked soil and smoked wood. That wild funk comes through on the palate as well, with smoky red fruits, gamy lamb and damp earth flavors."
Au Contraire 2016 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Au Contraire,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.6%,$28,88,Virginie Boone,"Big boned and fruit forward, this is a sizable wine in style and weight, with waves of cherry and strawberry greeting the palate. It shows its coastal provenance in its savory seasonings of clove, black tea and sage."
Vestini Campagnano 2012 Concarosso Red (Galluccio),Vestini Campagnano,Red,Concarosso,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Galluccio, Southern Italy, Italy",14%,,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"This robust blend of 85% Aglianico and 15% Pallagrello Nero has aromas of toasted oak, stewed prune and baked plum.

Riaza 2015 Unorthodox Syrah (Mokelumne River),Riaza,Red,Unorthodox,,"Mokelumne River, Central Valley, California, US",14.5%,$26,88,Jim Gordon,"This bold and full-bodied wine has ripe jammy Port-like aromas, plump blackberry flavors and a rich, almost-sweet, palate impression. It's certainly mouth coating and tooth staining."
Black Cabra 2016 Chardonnay (Mendoza),Black Cabra,White,,Chardonnay,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.8%,$10,84,Michael Schachner,"Pulpy aromas of applesauce are a bit flat. This feels chunky on the palate, with low acidity. White-fruit flavors suggest canned peach and pear, and it tastes sweet on the finish."
Yamhill Valley 2016 Estate Pinot Blanc (McMinnville),Yamhill Valley,White,Estate,Pinot Blanc,"McMinnville, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$22,85,Paul Gregutt,"This lacks much in the way of fruit, but what's there is green. That said, there's something in the nose that seems past ripeness also, and the bitter phenolic finish does nothing to help."
La Mannella 2006 I Poggiarelli  (Brunello di Montalcino),La Mannella,Red,I Poggiarelli,"Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese","Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14%,,94,,"Earthy overtones of wild mushroom and moist soil add pretty dimension to this classy Brunello. At the core of I Poggiarelli, however, are black fruit, sweet spice, toasted nut and long-lasting black cherry flavors."
Sebastiani 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),Sebastiani,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$19,83,Virginie Boone,"Aged in stainless steel, this faint SB is herb-y and slightly grassy. Sweetness on the midpalate sticks around before the quick finish."
Morgan 1999 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Morgan,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",,$38,88,,"Bright cherry and spice flavors dominate, followed by racy cinnamon, tea and pepper notes.  Moderate body and silky texture."
Bisol NV Cartizze  (Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze),Bisol,Sparkling,Cartizze,"Prosecco, Sparkling","Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze, Veneto, Italy",,VivinoGary's Wine,90,,"An emphasis on yellow fruit, pear and measured banana almost makes you think Bisol employs a different yeast selection on their Cartizze Cru. The wine is thick and creamy, with excellent opulence and just the right measure of sweetness."
Burgess 2001 Syrah (Lake County),Burgess,Red,,,"Lake County, Lake County, California, US",13.9%,$19,85,,"Spice and anise notes pepper stewed fruit on the nose. The palate delivers straightforward, soft red fruit couched in a dusty blanket. Soft and supple; an easy drinker."
Pio Cesare 2008  Dolcetto d'Alba,Pio Cesare,Red,,"Dolcetto, Italian Red","Dolcetto d'Alba, Piedmont, Italy",13%,$21,88,,"A strong showing, with tones of blueberry and iodine interwoven with animal and barnyard scents on the nose. The palate shows red fruit flavors with flowers at the back and ends on a leather note. Refined tannins allow for immediate consumption."
Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2011 Xairel Red (Tejo),Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo,Red,Xairel,Portuguese Red,"Tejo, Portugal",13%,$6,82,Roger Voss,"A wine with a strange mix of fruitiness and lean, green flavors. There's some black currant coming through the stalky character. The finish is juicy, but it's hard to find pleasure here."
Bridlewood 2003 Syrah (Central Coast),Bridlewood,Red,,,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$8,84,,"Nice and dry, and although it's a little sharp and tart in green mint, this inexpensive wine offers plenty of black cherry and cocoa flavors wrapped into smooth tannins."
Rui Roboredo Madeira 2015 Castello d'Alba Colheita Red (Douro),Rui Roboredo Madeira,Red,Castello d'Alba Colheita,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",13%,$10,86,Roger Voss,"The wine is soft, and full of fruit with attractive spicy black currant flavors.

González Byass NV Apostoles Palo Cortado Viejo Sherry (Jerez),González Byass,Port/Sherry,Apostoles Palo Cortado Viejo,Sherry,"Jerez, Andalucia, Spain",20%,$49,91,Michael Schachner,"A unique and individual style of Sherry, even among palo cortados. It's dark amber in color, with a pungent mix of aromas that include molasses, raw brown sugar, chocolate and campfire. Feels fresh on the tongue, with coffee, dark chocolate and core peach and citrus flavors."
Viña Casablanca 2010 Cefiro Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),Viña Casablanca,White,Cefiro Reserva,Chardonnay,"Casablanca Valley, Chile",14%,$12,87,Michael Schachner,"Opens with toast and vanilla aromas along with baked apple and oak.

Earthy tannins rise up midway through the wine, providing strength and structure before finishing long and lean."
Domaine Pfister 2012 Tradition Riesling (Alsace),Domaine Pfister,White,Tradition,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$29,85,Roger Voss,"Pfister's Riesling is classic, simple and fruity. With its light mineral texture, tight acidity and delicate lemon and grapefruit flavors, it's totally ready to drink."
Ardiri 2012 Estate Grown Vineyard Select Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),Ardiri,Red,Estate Grown Vineyard Select,Pinot Noir,"Chehalem Mountains, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",12.9%,$30,87,Paul Gregutt,"Toasty and broad at first sip, the oak flavors outrun the fruit. Thin cranberry and tart raspberry notes are carried into a quick, chocolaty finish."
Albert Morot 2015 Les Teurons Premier Cru  (Beaune),Albert Morot,Red,Les Teurons Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Beaune, Burgundy, France",13%,$45,94,Roger Voss,"This structured firm wine is full of tannins as well as ripe fruit. It is concentrated, showing smoky wood flavors as well as plenty of red berries. The wine will develop slowly, with the rich fruits coming through to give a generous wine. Drink from 2024."

The well-balanced flavor profile features notes of cherry, strawberry, smoked meat, Mediterranean herbs and eucalyptus.

Terra d'Alter 2010 Touriga Nacional (Alentejano),Terra d'Alter,Red,,"Touriga Nacional, Portuguese Red","Alentejano, Portugal",13.5%,$17,86,Roger Voss,"This very ripe interpretation of Touriga Nacional brings out a dark black-plum flavor, which hides the grape's natural tannins. It is chunky, with powerful, forward fruit."
Robert Hall 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),Robert Hall,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$16,89,Matt Kettmann,"A stony, wet cement-like aromas meets Anjou lime and jasmine touches on the nose of this bottling from a winery recently acquired by O'Neill Vintners. The palate leads with a dollop of acidity and slowly releases lemongrass, Asian pear and ripe nectarine flavors, cut with a tense streak of lime."
The Winemaker's Loft 2007 Chardonnay-Pinot Gris White (Yakima Valley),The Winemaker's Loft,White,Chardonnay-Pinot Gris,White Blend,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$13,88,Paul Gregutt,"A fresh, vibrant white wine that shows the touch and talent of winemaker Michael Haddox. It's a fine match of grapes, with bright (and co-fermented) flavors of cut pear and apple, a leesy, textural body, and a lingering finish that refreshes the palate without being tiring."
Guerrieri Rizzardi 2013  Soave Classico,Guerrieri Rizzardi,White,,White Blend,"Soave Classico, Veneto, Italy",12.5%,$13,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Floral scents of peach blossom, broom and a whiff of pear mingle in the glass. On the bright palate, toasted almond and aromatic herb give interest to the core of Golden Delicious apple and citrus. It's refreshing and balanced with vibrant acidity."
Brancott 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Brancott,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Marlborough, New Zealand",12.5%,$13,88,Joe Czerwinski,"Pungent and nettle-like upfront, but those leafy elements are balanced by bright grapefruity flavors on the palate. It's medium in body and fresh, clean and appealing on the finish. Hard to do better at the price."
Koyle 2009 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),Koyle,Red,Reserva,Carmenère,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",14%,$20,88,Michael Schachner,"Hard spice, licorice, raisin and pastry aromas come with just a spot of green.

Clau de Nell 2014 Cabernet Franc (Anjou),Clau de Nell,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"Anjou, Loire Valley, France",13%,$50,91,Roger Voss,"This is a rich, smoky red-fruit-flavored wine. One of three wines produced by the estate that was created by the late Anne-Claude Leflaive of Domaine Leflaive in Burgundy, it is made from biodynamically grown grapes. Wood aged, it shows spice as well as the cool fruitiness that gives the wine both its crispness and aging potential. Drink from 2018."
Byblos 2004 Bonarda (Mendoza),Byblos,Red,,"Bonarda, Other Red","Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",12.5%,$8,83,Michael Schachner,"A kosher Bonarda with hard, spicy aromas but not a whole lot of fruit. Lean and peppery in the mouth, with toasty, bitter finishing flavors. Deep diggers will find some black cherry in the center. Imported by Abarbanel Wine Company."
Shafer 2012 Merlot (Napa Valley),Shafer,Red,,Merlot,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15.1%,$52,90,Virginie Boone,"A Cab lover's Merlot, this wine is massively constructed, a behemoth of tobacco-laced blue fruit and smoke, nearing pie-like proportion. With time and/or a decant, it'll reveal pretty violet on the nose, and take on a sultry juiciness to overcome its weight. Lay this baby down through 2022."
Lamoreaux Landing 2011 Estate Bottled Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),Lamoreaux Landing,White,Estate Bottled,Gewürztraminer,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12.8%,$15,87,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Delicate aromas of apple blossoms and fresh pears belie a surprisingly textured, mouthfilling Gewürztraminer, with concentrated stone-fruit flavors and a bristling minerality. Drink now."
Domaine Boyar 2016 Selection Traminer (Thracian Valley),Domaine Boyar,White,Selection,"Traminer, Other White",,12%,$12,89,Jeff Jenssen,"This straw-colored Traminer has aromas of honeysuckle, lime zest and lemon blossom. Flavors of cantaloupe, honeydew melon and kiwi unfold on the palate and carry through to the fruity finish."
Schug 2001 Heritage Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),Schug,Red,Heritage Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$50,90,,"This is a balanced and elegant Cab. It's almost muted in the quiet interplay of cassis fruit, smoky oak and rich tannins. It's the sort of wine you reach for with real food, as opposed to tasting competitions, and it's likely to age well through the decade."
Fess Parker 2017 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Fess Parker,Red,Fiddlestix Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$60,93,Matt Kettmann,"Soft yet dark aromas of black raspberry sorbet are lifted by star anise and wild mint aromas on the nose of this bottling. There is a rich boysenberry depth to the palate, alongside fennel pollen, rounded baking spice and a plum-skin tang."
Telmo Rodríguez 2001 Molino Real Mountain Wine Moscatel (Málaga),Telmo Rodríguez,Dessert,Molino Real Mountain Wine,"Moscatel, Muscat","Málaga, Andalucia, Spain",,$48,88,Michael Schachner,"There's not a region or grape type that Telmo Rodríguez won't tackle, and here he's on to Moscatel in the deep south. This wine exhibits lilac aromas with hints of smoked ham and hard cheese. It's not a perfect bouquet, but it is intriguing. In addition, look for a bulky but rewarding palate featuring chewy sweet fruit and moderate acidity."
Peju 2002 Petit Verdot (Napa Valley),Peju,Red,,Petit Verdot,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$35,89,,"What a roll Peju has been on with Bordeaux wines. This is the first Petit Verdot I've had from them, and it's very good, given the variety's inherent limitations. It's dark, very dry, full-bodied and intensely tannic, with currant flavors. You could try stashing it away for a decade, or drink it now with a well-marbled steak."
Siltstone 2011 Guadalupe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Oregon),Siltstone,Red,Guadalupe Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",12.3%,$32,87,Paul Gregutt,"This single-vineyard designate is labeled simply Oregon, but is actually Dundee Hills. Somewhat dilute fruit flavors suggest pomegranate and tart strawberries. Despite 18 months in half new French oak, the wood does not overwhelm the fruit, and the wine actually improves overnight. Give it a good decanting for optimum drinking."
Château Bianca 1999 Gewürztraminer (Willamette Valley),Château Bianca,White,,Gewürztraminer,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$9,84,Paul Gregutt,"This wine has a bright, spicy attack in the aroma that is unmistakably Gewurztraminer. The fruit is ripe, almost fat, with a strong, spicy flavor in the mid-palate and a heaviness in the finish. There is also a little bit of heat, and a slight impression of sweetness from the fruit."
Muscardini 2010 Monte Rosso Vineyard Sangiovese (Sonoma Valley),Muscardini,Red,Monte Rosso Vineyard,Sangiovese,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$36,85,,"This wine is hot, soft and simple, with blackberry jam, chocolate and anise flavors. The fruit is enormously concentrated. Inelegant, but it will partner well with barbecue."
Paltrinieri 2018 Radice  (Lambrusco di Sorbara),Paltrinieri,Sparkling,Radice,"Lambrusco di Sorbara, Italian Red","Lambrusco di Sorbara, Central Italy, Italy",11.5%,$24,95,Kerin O’Keefe,"One of the best Lambruscos out there, this delicious, vibrant wine opens with enticing scents of wild red berry, yellow stone fruit, citrus blossom and a yeasty, comforting whiff of pastry dough. Made by carrying out the secondary fermentation in the bottle, the dry, delicious palate delivers pink grapefruit, crushed strawberry and tangerine alongside crisp acidity and a saline note."
Feudo di Santa Tresa 2006 Rina Ianca White (Sicilia),Feudo di Santa Tresa,White,Rina Ianca,White Blend,"Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",14%,$13,87,,"Creamy and smooth with soft oak shadings, this balanced 70-30 blend of full-bodied Grillo and fragrant Viognier is redolent of honey and bee's wax with softer tones of apricot and pear in the background. The wine has good density and structure but ends on a bright, crisp note."
Albert Morot 2016 Les Bressandes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Albert Morot,Red,Les Bressandes Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Beaune, Burgundy, France",13%,$56,93,Roger Voss,"A concentrated, ripe wine with the potential for great fruit as well as structure, this already offers bold fruits. With its tannins and juicy red-berry flavors, it will be a fine wine from 2023."
Fabio Motta 2015 Le Gonnare  (Bolgheri Superiore),Fabio Motta,Red,Le Gonnare,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Bolgheri Superiore, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$50,93,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made with 85% Merlot and 15% Syrah, this polished red has inviting aromas of mature black-skinned berry, purple flower, Mediterranean brush and a whiff of sea breeze. Taut and juicy, the elegantly structured palate doles out ripe Marasca cherry, blackberry, ground pepper and a salty mineral note framed in firm fine-grained tannins. A hint of toasted hazelnut marks the finish."
Echeverria 2010 Limited Edition Carmenère (Curicó Valley),Echeverria,Red,Limited Edition,Carmenère,"Curicó Valley, Chile",14%,$25,86,Michael Schachner,"A dark berry aroma comes with a distinct whiff of green. On the palate, the wine feels crisp and clampy, while the flavors of spicy, herbal plum and berry teeter on the edge of being green. It tastes briary and like tomato sauce on the finish."
Domaine Boyar 2015 Traminer (Thracian Valley),Domaine Boyar,White,,"Traminer, Other White",,12%,$10,88,Jeff Jenssen,"A bouquet of jasmine, honeysuckle and green apple entice you in to sip of this refined Traminer. There are balanced flavors of ginger, passion fruit and apricot and a clean, acidic finish."
Kangarilla Road 2002 Zinfandel (McLaren Vale),Kangarilla Road,Red,,Zinfandel,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",16%,$33,88,,"Spicy cherry aromas lead to similar flavors on the palate—cherries, spice and plums. Finishes a little thick and portlike. Very enjoyable overall. How often do you find a very good Aussie Zin?"
Chakana 2017 Maipe Malbec Rosé (Mendoza),Chakana,Rose,Maipe Malbec,Rosé,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13%,$13,82,Michael Schachner,Wayward aromas are earthy and not terribly fresh. This has a dark tint and a clunky mouthfeel. Dry peppery flavors of stale citrus are briny.
Krug NV Rosé 23ème Edition Brut  (Champagne),Krug,Sparkling,Rosé 23ème Edition Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12.5%,$250,95,Roger Voss,"Krug's releases have always shown a wonderful balance between fruit and maturity. This rosé, the 23rd blending, is no exception. The nutty character of a mature Champagne is there along with red fruits, intense acidity from Pinot Noir and impeccable balance at the end. The wine is ready to drink."
Château des Jacques 2012 Clos du Grand Carquelin  (Moulin-à-Vent),Château des Jacques,Red,Clos du Grand Carquelin,Gamay,"Moulin-à-Vent, Beaujolais, France",13%,$43,93,Roger Voss,"This powerful, single-vineyard wine is both fruity and structured. Dense tannins and dark cherry fruits are beautifully balanced with the wood aging. Wait to drink this wine until 2017."
J. Christopher 2013 Lia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),J. Christopher,Red,Lia's Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Chehalem Mountains, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13%,$58,94,Paul Gregutt,"This begins with compelling aromas of rose petals and breakfast tea. Those tea-like tannins underscore an elegant wine with subtle fruit flavors. A delicate dance partners the fresh cherry fruit, the baking spices and other barrel-influenced accents, soft but penetrating tannins and the lightly chalky minerality. Lovely already, it should continue to drink well through 2025."
Weinrieder 2007 Grande Reserve Riesling (Niederösterreich),Weinrieder,White,Grande Reserve,Riesling,"Niederösterreich, Austria",,,92,Roger Voss,"A semisweet wine, all currants and ripe fruit. The sweetness comes from superripe fruit, giving a delicious balance with the acidity. Flavors of yellow apples, tarragon and all-spice come together in an exciting finish."
Hungry Hawk 2018 Elliot Ranch Reserve Albariño (San Diego County),Hungry Hawk,White,Elliot Ranch Reserve,Albariño,"San Diego County, South Coast, California, US",13.5%,$38,89,Matt Kettmann,"Clean aromas of chalk, Asian pear and melon are crisp and pure on the nose, which ends on a slight hint of almond. Sliced green pear, tight nectarine and a tiny touch of toast flavors show on the pleasantly crisp palate."
Domaine Louis Moreau 2012 Vaillons Premier Cru  (Chablis),Domaine Louis Moreau,White,Vaillons Premier Cru,Chardonnay,"Chablis, Burgundy, France",12.5%,,92,Roger Voss,"Yellow fruit aromas promise richness. That's delivered with the apricot and mango flavors, balanced acidity and a ripe while crisp aftertaste. The wine is ripe, full in the mouth. It's still young, and will be better drunk from 2017."
Colin 2001 Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),Colin,Sparkling,Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut,Chardonnay,"Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,,91,Roger Voss,"Mainly from grand cru vineyards in Cramant, this is a ripe, smooth, creamy wine whose minerality is subordinated to rich white fruits and a pure, dense structure. Despite its relative youth, the richness means this wine is ready to drink now."
Viticultori Associati Canicatti 2008 Aynat Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),Viticultori Associati Canicatti,Red,Aynat,"Nero d'Avola, Italian Red","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",14.5%,,88,,"Aynat is a ripe and chewy expression of Nero d'Avola with aromas of milk chocolate, moist tobacco and chewy ripe cherry. It is a rich, dense wine that is also pleasingly simple and genuine at the same time."
Catherine & Pierre Breton 2017 Trinch! Cabernet Franc (Bourgueil),Catherine & Pierre Breton,Red,Trinch!,Cabernet Franc,"Bourgueil, Loire Valley, France",13.5%,$27,87,Roger Voss,"Rabelais, the lover of all things good in life, used the word “trinch” like “cheers.” This welcoming wine comes from a blend of gravel and clay soils. Made to drink young, it is packed with red fruits from biodynamically grown grapes. Fresh acidity and just a modicum of tannins have produced a wine to drink now."
Daou 2017 Solomon Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),Daou,Red,Solomon Hills Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$90,93,Matt Kettmann,"Black raspberry aromas are lifted by herbal touches of bay leaf and wild thyme on the nose of this bottling—one of the first Pinot Noirs for the Daou brothers. It's medium bodied on the palate with bright raspberry fruit, herbal touches of marjoram and pencil shavings and a strong acid that carries into the finish."
Hendry 2014 Blocks 7 and 22 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Hendry,Red,Blocks 7 and 22,Zinfandel,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15.3%,$36,93,Virginie Boone,"This is a delicate spicy wine despite its robust ripeness and brawny underside. Compost and brambly brush combine with blackberry and an undeniably delicious streak of white pepper, making for a complex, complete wine that's enjoyable from start to finish."
Tamarack Cellars 2009 Seven Hills Vineyard Reserve Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),Tamarack Cellars,Red,Seven Hills Vineyard Reserve,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Walla Walla Valley (OR), Oregon Other, Oregon, US",14.7%,$50,93,Paul Gregutt,"This is principally Cabernet, with just small amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot in the blend. Still remarkably young and tightly-wound, it's showing tart cherries, violets and blueberries, along with bracing acidity and minerality. The finish is both elegant and intense, lingering long after the last sip."
Dusted Valley 2006 BFM Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Dusted Valley,Red,BFM Red,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$35,90,Paul Gregutt,"Blow your Freaking Mind is what BFM stands for. It's a Bordeaux blend, mostly Merlot, with sharply-defined berry-flavored fruit, bright acidity and a fine focus. The mix of Wisconsin and French oak (60% new) gives it a pleasing, chocolaty finish."
Temple Bruer 2003 Chenin Blanc (Langhorne Creek),Temple Bruer,White,,Chenin Blanc,"Langhorne Creek, South Australia, Australia",12.5%,$15,84,,"If peach aromatherapy exists—that is, the purest, most concentrated smell of peach in a bottle—this nose is it. After a while, though, an acrylic-like aroma starts emerging, and the palate shows evidence of both acrylic and peach. Still, it's a worthwhile wine, but would have been better with the focus on the fruit. Imported by Australian Wine Connection."
Jean-Baptiste Adam 2008 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),Jean-Baptiste Adam,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$16,90,,"Attractive gold color. Intense aromas of ripe stone fruit fruit. Strong earthy minerality and a hint of honeysuckle adding complexity. Broad persistent flavors across the palate with focused minerality and an earthy savoriness that is beautifully balanced with the ripe fruit. Crisp and taut with a long, layered finish."
Arboleda 2005 Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),Arboleda,Red,,Carmenère,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",14.5%,$20,86,Michael Schachner,"Clumsy as an ox at first, but better with airing. This is your classic slightly herbal Carmenère, and in the folds you'll find soft berry fruit, copious oak and a certain creaminess that makes the mouthfeel plush. It's good if you like a fat, soft-tannin wine. But if tobacco and green notes turn you off, then it might be better to steer clear."
Toscani 2017 Lumeo Syrah (Toscana),Toscani,Red,Lumeo,,"Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$49,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"This Syrah has aromas recalling mature black-skinned berry, underbrush and a hint of smoke. The juicy palate offers black currant, clove and black pepper alongside polished tannins. Drink through 2027."
De Loach 2010 Cool Coastal Vineyards Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),De Loach,White,Cool Coastal Vineyards,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.5%,$18,90,,"Great acidity and minerality in this elegant young wine. Doesn't show the rich concentration of De Loach's single-vineyard Chards, but then again, it costs far less. It's actually a good value for a dry, minerally and complex Russian River Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold."
Castello d'Albola 2014  Chianti Classico,Castello d'Albola,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",13%,$19,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Delicate scents suggesting dark berry, moist soil and a whiff ground clove waft out of the glass. The fresh, light-bodied palate offers sour cherry and star anise alongside bright acidity and rather loose knit tannins. Drink through 2019."
Bump 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Coast),Bump,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14%,$20,86,,"Brisk acidity makes this white wine almost tingly. It's also exhibits light vanilla bean, white peach and pineapple flavors."
Quanta Terra 2013 Grande Reserva Branco White (Douro),Quanta Terra,White,Grande Reserva Branco,Portuguese White,"Douro, Portugal",13.5%,$30,91,Roger Voss,"This is a seriously wood-aged wine, sumptuous in its smooth and creamy texture. It has citrus, lime and really fresh acidity to balance the toast and rich fruitiness. Elegant and worth aging further. Drink from 2016."
Château Lamartine 2015 Cuvée Particulière  (Cahors),Château Lamartine,Red,Cuvée Particulière,,"Cahors, Southwest France, France",13.5%,$25,92,Roger Voss,"Wood aging and low yields have given this rich wine its density and glossy, ripe potential. Two tannic grapes, Malbec and Tannat, together have given a striking structure while also bringing out swathes of black fruit. Drink this powerful wine from 2022."
Santa Ema 2006 60/40 Reserve Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Maipo Valley),Santa Ema,Red,60/40 Reserve Barrel Select,"Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Maipo Valley, Chile",13.5%,$12,85,Michael Schachner,"Syrupy on the nose, but also green at the core. This Cab-Merlot blend is a little disconnected in that it pushes both rich, syrupy characteristics as well as more snappy, red-fruit notes and herbal hints. In the end it finds a relatively happy place, but the pieces don't seem to fit perfectly together."
Ingrid Groiss 2015 Pankraz Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),Ingrid Groiss,White,Pankraz Reserve,Grüner Veltliner,"Niederösterreich, Austria",13.5%,$47,93,Anne Krebiehl MW,"There is something that makes me think about a summer forest: Is it the fresh moss, the fresh green foliage, the implied ease and freshness of light green foliage on a warm day? The palate stuns with white pepper and purity and combines fruit ripeness with ballerina-like poise. Wonderful texture. Prepare to be moved."
Kuentz-Bas 2000 Grand Cru Pfersigberg Riesling (Alsace),Kuentz-Bas,White,Grand Cru Pfersigberg,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",,$42,89,Roger Voss,"There's already some petrol character to this attractive wine, which also has great acidity and a fine, bone- dry feel. On the palate, there are some intense currant flavors. A great food wine with good concentration. Imported by Kermit Lynch."
Château Puyanché 2018  Francs Côtes de Bordeaux,Château Puyanché,White,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Francs Côtes de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$16,90,Roger Voss,"Baked-apple and wood aromas show strongly in this ripe wine.

Hirsch Vineyards 2012 West Ridge Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Hirsch Vineyards,Red,West Ridge,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",12.8%,$85,88,Jim Gordon,"In this wine, a mellow, aged character comes from subtle aromas that are part fruit, part earth and herb, and from the satiny smooth texture and almost overripe plum flavors. Neither tannic nor tart, the mouthfeel is soft and plush."
André Tixier et Fils 2012 Millésimé Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),André Tixier et Fils,Sparkling,Millésimé Premier Cru Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12.5%,$145,90,Roger Voss,"Based in Chigny-lès-Roses on the Montagne de Reims, this organic producer has made a well-structured vintage.

Santa Julia 2011 [+] Malbec (Mendoza),Santa Julia,Red,[+],Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13%,$10,87,Michael Schachner,"A fruitball of a Malbec, with bright, friendly aromas of berry, cola and cherry cough drop. It feels full, round and well balanced, with a black cherry flavor bearing a mild herbal underbelly. The finish is fruity without being heavy."
Setzer 2005 8000 Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),Setzer,White,8000,Grüner Veltliner,"Niederösterreich, Austria",,$33,89,Roger Voss,"From densely planted vines, this is a ripe, very fruity wine, with low acidity, emphasizing the cream and pepper character of the grape. It is not the style of Grüner that can be drunk too young—give it another year to be at its optimum."

It feels concentrated and jacked up, with fully ripe, creamy flavors of blackberry, cassis and pastry. This is a chewy, layered, dense and jammy New World Syrah ready to drink now–2014."
Raats Family 2005 Original Chenin Blanc (South Africa),Raats Family,White,Original,Chenin Blanc,"South Africa, South Africa",13.5%,$13,89,,"One of South Africa's best with Chenin, Bruwer Raats has hit another home run with this unwooded wine. It kicks off with perfumed citrus aromas, then lets fly with lively almond-tinged flavors of orange and peach. Vibrant in the mouth with beautifully matching acidity, this is a wine that calls for food, but can certainly be enjoyed alone."
Vinovalie 2015 Tarani Rosé (Comté Tolosan),Vinovalie,Rose,Tarani,Rosé,"Comté Tolosan, Southwest France, France",12%,,85,Roger Voss,"Fresh, crisp and fruity, this is a raspberry- and red currant-flavored wine that is featherlight and refreshing. It's a great summer wine."

Sullivan,This wine is all about power and hedonism. Brooding dark fruit aromas meld with black licorice and lead to a seamless full-bodied blackberry and black-cherry flavors. It demands another sip.
Jean-Michel Sorbe 2018  Quincy,Jean-Michel Sorbe,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Quincy, Loire Valley, France",13%,$23,90,Roger Voss,"Now owned by the Sancerre producer, Joseph Mellot, this estate is a standard bearer in Quincy.

Educated Guess 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Educated Guess,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$20,87,,"Another good Cabernet from this winery. It's a very grapey Cabernet, with fresh, jammy blackberry fruit that tastes like it just came from the fermenter. But it's dry and balanced and likeable."
Cuvaison 2009 Chardonnay (Carneros),Cuvaison,White,,Chardonnay,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$23,89,,"From the Napa side of Carneros comes this crisp, fruity young Chardonnay.

The cherry fruit is laced with mint and tobacco leaf notes. Drink now."
Santi 2011  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Santi,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Amarone della Valpolicella Classico, Veneto, Italy",16%,$49,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with aromas of forest floor, mature dark-skinned fruit and leather.

Peppery, especially in aroma, it offers full-bodied leathery black cherry fruit and concentrated layers of savory chocolate. It's delicious and would make a fine pairing with any steak."
Oracle 2002 Shiraz (Western Cape),Oracle,Red,,,"Western Cape, South Africa",14%,$8,87,,"Solid, tart-sweet fruit shines in this flavorful Western Cape Shiraz. Winemaker Linley Schultz's confident hand shows in the judicious use of oak, balanced mouthfeel and tasty, lingering close. Shows some complexity and the structure to evolve. Enjoy through 2007, maybe longer."
Elyse 2003 Petite Sirah (Rutherford),Elyse,Red,,Petite Sirah,"Rutherford, Napa, California, US",,$36,92,,"About as fancy as Petite Sirah gets. Has the bones and authority of a great Cab.

It's just beginning to pick up aged notes, making it sweeter and more mellow than it would have been two or three years ago. Kudos to Balletto for holding it back before  release. Drink now–2016."
El Enemigo 2010 Gran Enemigo Agrelo Single Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Mendoza),El Enemigo,Red,Gran Enemigo Agrelo Single Vineyard,Cabernet Franc,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.9%,$90,91,Michael Schachner,"For Cab Franc, this is super ripe, with floral, perfumed, earthy aromas of cassis and wild berries blended with pastry and vanilla.

The wine remains tart, sharp and herbal, with some chalkiness in the tannins."

Portugal Ramos,Rose,,Rosé,"Vinho Verde, Portugal",11.5%,$9,86,Roger Voss,"Candy pink in color, this wine made from the local Espadeiro and Padeiro grapes, is dry with a touch of caramel, as well as red-currant fruitiness.

On the full-bodied palate, notes of licorice, blood orange and tangy mineral accent a core of dried cherry. Close-grained tannins offer taut support. Drink 2022–2029."
STG 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),STG,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$15,80,,"Harsh and burnt, with medicinal, slightly sweet cherry flavors, this disagreeable wine also has rough tannins."
Nittnaus Hans und Christine 2003 Nit'ana Red (Burgenland),Nittnaus Hans und Christine,Red,Nit'ana,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Burgenland, Austria",13.5%,$24,88,Roger Voss,"An open, generous, ripe wine, with fresh red plum fruit flavors, layered with acidity. The barrique aging is still apparent, leaving high toast. Despite the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this still tastes very Austrian and spicy, the Zweigelt and Blaufränkisch dominating."
Cantina Tramin 2002 Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),Cantina Tramin,White,,"Pinot Bianco, Pinot Blanc","Alto Adige, Northeastern Italy, Italy",,$13,87,Roger Voss,"A full, rich, concentrated wine, with fat, ripe fruit and a touch of acidity. Big and powerful, it has a fresh, clean aftertaste."
Argami 2016 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda),Argami,White,Old Vines,"Verdejo, Spanish White","Rueda, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$15,85,Michael Schachner,"Yeasty but generic white-fruit aromas come with a hint of vanilla cookie. This feels angular and acidic, not full and complete. Citrus flavors are both briny and sour, while this tastes salty on the finish."
Garnet 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Garnet,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",13.8%,,91,Matt Kettmann,"Winemaker Alison Crowe does it again, managing to provide delicious and interesting wine at a tremendous value. Deep red strawberry, black pepper, graphite, black plum, chocolate, licorice and dried chiles show on the nose. The sip brings rounded black cherry fruit lifted by anise, dark chocolate and a touch of olive flavors."
Sattlerhof 2018 Kapellenweingarten Morillon (Südsteiermark),Sattlerhof,White,Kapellenweingarten,"Morillon, Chardonnay","Südsteiermark, Austria",12.5%,$45,95,Anne Krebiehl MW,"This wine's very shy nose gives next to nothing away, showing a slight sense of lemon and a touch of dried corn husk. The palate is just as tightly coiled and does not yet reveal its full flavors. The structure, however, is already on full display, showing a gentle, smooth texture without an ounce of fat. Drink 2025–2040."
Dashe Cellars 2009 Louvau Vineyard Old Vines Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),Dashe Cellars,Red,Louvau Vineyard Old Vines,Zinfandel,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.6%,$32,88,,"Dashe always produces dependably good Zinfandels from this vineyard. The 2009 shows real complexity, with an earthy, mushroomy richness alongside the raspberry, red currant and spice flavors. It's very dry, with a fine structure of acid and tannins. Marked by the rusticity that characterizes Dry Creek Zinfandels. It calls for pairing with rich stews, braised meats and barbecue."
Schmidt 2017 Sauvignon Blanc (Applegate Valley),Schmidt,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Applegate Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",13.8%,$22,83,Paul Gregutt,"Soft and soapy, suggesting high pH, this wine is light in style, with easygoing citrus flavors. The palate is soft and lacking in an acidic lift."
Matetic 2011 Corralillo Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),Matetic,White,Corralillo,Sauvignon Blanc,"San Antonio, Chile",14%,$16,88,Michael Schachner,"Round and grassy smelling, but turning more pungent and pointed with airing. Shows good grip and a slight spritz on the palate in front of grassy, green flavors of lime, bell pepper and tarragon. Pithy on the finish, where jalapeño and white-pepper notes rise up and take over."
Amity 2009 Crannell Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Amity,Red,Crannell Single Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$35,90,Paul Gregutt,"Dark in color and flavor, the Crannell brings ripe fruit flavors of black cherry and prune.

Season 2019 Transparency Sparkling (Southern Oregon),Season,Sparkling,Transparency,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Southern Oregon, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",11.2%,$18,86,Paul Gregutt,"Screw-capped and lightly fizzy, this Muscat, Riesling and Müller-Thurgau blend is aromatic and fruity, with soda pop flavors. Consistent from vintage to vintage in both style and flavor, it's a good candidate for a mixer or punch wine."
Provam 2013 Portal do Fidalgo Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),Provam,White,Portal do Fidalgo,"Alvarinho, Albariño","Vinho Verde, Portugal",12.5%,,92,Roger Voss,"This is a great Alvarinho, full of ripe and creamy fruit that is so pure and crisp while bringing out a tight, mineral character. From the north of Vinho Verde, across the river from Spain, this shows the texture of the granite soil combined with the exceptional ripeness of the fruit. Age for a year, drink from the end of 2015."
McManis 2013 Petite Sirah (California),McManis,Red,,Petite Sirah,"California, California Other, California, US",13.5%,$11,89,Jim Gordon,"An appetizing hickory-smoke aroma and bold fruit flavors make this one stand out, yet it doesn't go too far with the woody character. A hint of bacon blends well with the ripe blackberry flavors, and the rich texture and firm tannins make it a great wine to pair with big portions of protein."
Nora 2015 Peitán Albariño (Rías Baixas),Nora,White,Peitán,Albariño,"Rías Baixas, Galicia, Spain",13%,$16,87,Michael Schachner,"Typical Albariño aromas of white peach, white pepper and citrus fruits are about average. Bright citric acidity makes this racy, while salty tangerine, apricot and nectarine flavors end with pithy grit."
Terra Andina 2001 Carmenère (Central Valley),Terra Andina,Red,,Carmenère,"Central Valley, Chile",12.5%,$8,85,Michael Schachner,"A touch stewy and bulky, but still a positive wine from a good if now old vintage. Plum and cherry fruit on the palate seems ripe, and the finish is properly dry. A bit high in acidity, but still good in terms of mouthfeel."
LangeTwins 2012 Estate Grown Musqué Clone Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),LangeTwins,White,Estate Grown Musqué Clone,Sauvignon Blanc,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",13.2%,$15,89,Virginie Boone,"Offering aromas of sweet peach, this is a round, full Sauvignon Blanc with a pleasant texture. Light in alcohol but rich on the finish, it just begs for shellfish or melted goat cheese salad."
Bodegas Valdemar 2015 La Gargantilla Garnacha  (Rioja),Bodegas Valdemar,Red,La Gargantilla Garnacha,"Garnacha, Grenache","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",15%,$43,85,Michael Schachner,"Raspberry aromas are jammy, reedy and leafy, while on the palate this is hard and sappy, with weight. Jamminess is a recurring theme on this high-priced Garnacha. Flavors of cherry and rhubarb wrap up on an edgy, scrubbing finish."
Florent Descombe 2016 Cuvée B  (Beaujolais),Florent Descombe,Red,Cuvée B,Gamay,"Beaujolais, Beaujolais, France",12.5%,$35,85,Roger Voss,"This is a light wine, just juicy red cherries and bright acidity.

Hendry 1997 Block 7 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Hendry,Red,Block 7,Zinfandel,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$20,83,Paul Gregutt,"Fine complex nose mixes spice, briar, pie cherry, coffee and barnyard. Flavors are pleasant, with plummy fruit, but overall the wine doesn't have much depth or power. Finishes tannic and a little bitter."
Dominio de la Abadesa 2016 Verdejo (Rueda),Dominio de la Abadesa,White,,"Verdejo, Spanish White","Rueda, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$22,84,Michael Schachner,"A dull gold tint and steamrolling barrel aromas announce an oak-heavy wine that's tight, resiny and high in acid. Woody flavors of salted apricot echo on the finish."
Château Lalaudey 2013  Moulis-en-Médoc,Château Lalaudey,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Moulis-en-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",13%,$35,85,Roger Voss,"This wine is soft, juicy and light. It has only the slightest texture, leaving its flavors entirely with blackberry fruitiness. That makes it an attractive, open wine with a fresh aftertaste. Drink now."
Chamarré 2005 Selection Grenache-Shiraz (Vin de Pays de l'Ile de Beauté),Chamarré,Rose,Selection,"Grenache-Shiraz, Rhône-style Red Blend","Vin de Pays de l'Ile de Beauté, France",,$10,86,,"From the island of Corsica, this was our pick of the Chamarré wines,  combining stony, smoky aromas with flavors of strawberries and herbs.

The bouquet is all mocha and smoky/oaky richness, while the sticky, rich palate deals blackberry and chewy, rooty medicinality. Oaky and spicy late, with licorice and warmth. The best thing is that it's not heavy or overextracted despite being youthful and modern in style."
La Casa Maguila 2013 Cachito Mio  (Toro),La Casa Maguila,Red,Cachito Mio,"Tinta de Toro, Tempranillo","Toro, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$15,83,Michael Schachner,"Leather, mint and wet-dog aromas along with an overriding burn drive the nose toward a resiny, raw palate with snappy acidity and lots of oak. Buttery as well as briny red-fruit flavors are salty and taste mostly of wood resin."
Château de Corneilla 2009 Pur Sang Red (Côtes du Roussillon),Château de Corneilla,Red,Pur Sang,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Côtes du Roussillon, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",13%,$23,86,Lauren Buzzeo,"Boysenberry, blueberry and black cherry aromas lead on the nose of this wine, with a touch of warmth and chocolaty sensation following behind.

Wairau River 2004 Home Block Pinot Noir (Marlborough),Wairau River,Red,Home Block,Pinot Noir,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13.5%,$25,85,Joe Czerwinski,"Light ruby in color, this wine doesn't appear to be terribly rich or concentrated. But it's a charming, soft little Pinot, intended to caress the palate rather than stun it. Sous bois and cherries are framed by barrel-derived notes of caramel, cedar and vanilla. Ends slightly woody, but should smooth out in another few months."
Codorníu 2010 Gran Codorniu Pinot Noir (Cava),Codorníu,Sparkling,Gran Codorniu,Pinot Noir,"Cava, Catalonia, Spain",12%,$20,89,Michael Schachner,"Light, clean, peachy aromas provide for a nice opening. The palate on this Pinot Noir Cava is crisp, linear and citric, while flavors of tangerine, cherry pie and plum finish tight, citrusy and long. If you want zero funk and no faults in your bubbly, try this."
Laureano Gomez 2014 Malbec (Uco Valley),Laureano Gomez,Red,,Malbec,"Uco Valley, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.5%,$20,86,Michael Schachner,"This wine's stewy, herbal berry aromas are not very ripe or compelling.

Rockpile Winery 2019 Rockpile Ridge Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),Rockpile Winery,Red,Rockpile Ridge Vineyard,Zinfandel,"Rockpile, Sonoma, California, US",14.57%,$49,92,Virginie Boone,"Spicy and herbal, this high-elevation grown wine includes 6% Petite Sirah and is earthy and dusty in dark fruit.

Wine Drops 2018 Somnium Red (Douro),Wine Drops,Red,Somnium,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",14.5%,$21,93,Roger Voss,"This wine is the result of a new project from old vines. The wine has great richness while also having the dense concentration to be expected from a field blend. The wine is set for aging, with its firm core of tannins to offset the black fruits. Drink from 2023."
Hahn 2018 Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),Hahn,White,,Chardonnay,"Arroyo Seco, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$20,88,Matt Kettmann,"Yellow peach-flesh, lemon-balm and light almond aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend.

Clifford Bay 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Clifford Bay,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Marlborough, New Zealand",13%,$13,89,Joe Czerwinski,"This medium-weight wine starts off with wonderfully pure, expressive aromas of ripe passion fruit. On the palate, it's a bit prickly and leafy at first, like tomato stalks or nettle leaves. It then settles back down into tropical fruit on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now."
Luis Saenz 2017 Viura (Rioja),Luis Saenz,White,,"Viura, Spanish White","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",12%,$10,84,Michael Schachner,"Peach and nectarine aromas are simple and yeasty. Standard melony flavors rank as quiet, while on the finish this basic Viura is vapid and showing signs of fading."

It's a dry, ruggedly tannic wine, filled with rewarding blackberry, coffee, herb and spice flavors, and finishes with balance and a certain polish."
Basel Cellars 2011 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Basel Cellars,Red,Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.2%,$36,89,Sean P. Sullivan,"100% varietal, this wine exhibits aromas of dried herb, cigar box, and cherry. The flavors are tart, light and elegant, harmonizing on the finish."
Emilio Moro 2013 Malleolus  (Ribera del Duero),Emilio Moro,Red,Malleolus,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,VivinoGary's WineTotal Wine,89,Michael Schachner,"Grassy green underdeveloped aromas are not what Emilio Moro wines are known for, but given that this is a 2013, these scents are not without foundation. The palate follows the nose with raw pulling tannins and green-leaning flavors of basil, plum and boysenberry. A tight scouring finish is consistent with what came before it."
Forgeron 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),Forgeron,Red,,Merlot,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$27,91,Paul Gregutt,"Always a favorite from this Walla Walla producer, the 2005 Merlot includes about 6% Cabernet Franc. Firm and muscular, with a dense core of blackberry, black cherry and cassis, it sprinkles in ground coffee and a streak of licorice. The style is deep, dark, laced with graphite, and definitely built for long -term cellaring."

Baked apple aromas are touched with notes of almonds and cookies. The palate is substantially weighty with a density of flavors and a rich, full aftertaste. Ready to drink now."
Domaine Vincent Girardin 2011  Bienvenues Bâtard-Montrachet,Domaine Vincent Girardin,White,,Chardonnay,"Bienvenues Bâtard-Montrachet, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$304,95,Roger Voss,"It seems smooth and opulent initially, but then shows a structured side that brings out wood flavors, intense acidity and great depth. It's a powerful wine, very rich while keeping the freshness of the year and promising long-term aging. Drink from 2018."
Von Hövel 2007 Oberemmeler Hütte Spätlese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),Von Hövel,White,Oberemmeler Hütte Spätlese,Riesling,"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, Germany",7.5%,$30,91,Joe Czerwinski,
Bodegas Fuentespina 2012 First Label  (Ribera del Duero),Bodegas Fuentespina,Red,First Label,Tempranillo,"Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",14.5%,$110,90,Michael Schachner,"Creamy oak aromas shout “vanilla” and “wood resin” in full voice. This is a rough wine with stampeding tannins. Toasty boysenberry flavors are more pounding than elegant, while this tastes of bitter chocolate on an aggressive finish. Give this five years and it may show better but now it's massive and unsettled."
Schug 2000 Brut Rouge de Noirs Sparkling (Carneros),Schug,Sparkling,Brut Rouge de Noirs,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",,$25,86,,"Pretty dark for a bubbly, with dough, strawberry, smoke and vanilla aromas and delicate flavors of strawberries and cream. A bit rough in texture, but clean and dry. Might soften with a few years in the cellar."
Fanti 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,Fanti,Red,,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",15.5%,$45,86,Kerin O’Keefe,"This brawny wine opens with subdued aromas that recall leafy underbrush, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of stewed plum. The warm, monolithic palate offers prune steeped in spirits, toasted nut, dark spice and a green note of powdered sage alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish. The heat of evident alcohol on the close throws it further off-balance."
Crux 2018 Viognier (Alexander Valley),Crux,White,,Viognier,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.7%,$30,90,Virginie Boone,"Blended with 10% Grenache Blanc, this elegant white shows a whiff of petrol on the nose, following through on the palate with an oily, viscous varietal character. Lemon, green apple and a note of oak round it out, adorned in honeysuckle aromas."
Sequoia Grove 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Sequoia Grove,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.8%,DrizlyVivino,90,Virginie Boone,"Rich and robust with berry and currant fruit, this wine is rounded and full-bodied, with tannic weight and spicy layers of toasted oak."
Paul O'Brien 2014 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),Paul O'Brien,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Umpqua Valley, Southern Oregon, Oregon, US",13.5%,$28,89,Paul Gregutt,"Aromatic and inviting, this pushes strawberry preserves, cola and a dash of non-carbonated seltzer into the midpalate. It spent 14 months in one-quarter new French oak, and the color along with the already maturing fruit flavors suggest drinking this now through 2020."
Feudi di San Gregorio 1998 Falanghina White (Campania),Feudi di San Gregorio,White,Falanghina,White Blend,"Campania, Southern Italy, Italy",,$10,88,Michael Schachner,"One of southern Italy's oldest white grapes comes bursting to life in this nutty, lemony, honey-tinged winner that's a little like Tocai Friulano at its best. It goes like your hand in a glove when served with grilled octopus over braised radicchio."
Chopo 2016 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla),Chopo,Red,,,"Jumilla, Levante, Spain",14%,$12,86,Michael Schachner,"Ripe berry and cassis aromas feature more than enough charred wood and licorice scents. A palate with raw tannins is tough to penetrate. Flavors of burnt oak, clove, chocolate and stewed berry fruits finish similarly but drier. This is 70% Monastrell and 30% Syrah."
The Great Oregon Wine Company 2016 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),The Great Oregon Wine Company,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$20,88,Paul Gregutt,"This mixes light flavors of black cherry, cola and a touch of tanned leather. The tannins are soft and supple, and the mouthfeel has been rounded off for immediate drinkability."
Willm 2016 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace),Willm,White,Réserve,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$14,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"There is a touch of yellow mirabelle plum on the nose. The palate comes in with a more tart note of pith and zest. The slender body unites full fruit and lively freshness in a compact package, boosted by a little residual sweetness that nonetheless lets the wine finish dry."
Dutton-Goldfield 2017 Van Der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),Dutton-Goldfield,Red,Van Der Kamp Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Mountain, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$68,93,Virginie Boone,"Stemmy and earthy, this is a wildly exotic red wine, tense in sage and clove. Mountain strawberry, black cherry and rhubarb meet a wall of black tea, with compelling streaks of white pepper and firm tannin, combining for a forceful, balanced finish."
Château d'Aqueria 2003 Red (Lirac),Château d'Aqueria,Red,,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Lirac, Rhône Valley, France",,$19,88,Joe Czerwinski,"Much more famous for its Tavel rosé, this estate also turns out an attractive, easy to drink red from Lirac. The 2003 shows plenty of bright, fresh fruit married to complex briar and herb notes. Supple tannins make it approachable now."
Viña Bisquertt 2014 La Joya Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley),Viña Bisquertt,White,La Joya Gran Reserva,Sauvignon Blanc,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",13%,$11,86,Michael Schachner,"Citrus aromas lead the nose, followed by feline notes, yeasty vanilla and green pepper scents. This wine has a citric, tangy, hard-driving palate. Flavors of orange, tangerine and grapefruit finish with zesty acidity."
Fossil Point 2013 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),Fossil Point,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.4%,$18,86,Matt Kettmann,"This second, affordably minded label from the Center of Effort team shows caramelized cherries and chipped slate on the nose. Candied red fruits arise on the palate, along with bitter orange peels and a nice acidity, though there's a slightly odd film left on the tongue in the finish."
Castelli del Grevepesa 2007 Clemente VII Settimo Red (Toscana),Castelli del Grevepesa,Red,Clemente VII Settimo,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$30,90,,"A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with plush layers of black fruit, tobacco, chocolate and crushed black pepper. Full, ripe and modern, this has lingering notes of exotic spice and toasted nut on the finish."
ONX 2017 Reckoning Red (Templeton Gap District),ONX,Red,Reckoning,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Templeton Gap District, Central Coast, California, US",15.5%,$58,94,Matt Kettmann,"Aromas of leather, game, coffee, cracked pepper and roasted black cherry show on the nose of this blend of 55% Syrah, 15% Petite Sirah, 10% Tempranillo, 10% Grenache and 10% Zinfandel. The mouthwatering palate is loaded with rich flavors of soy and grilled meats alongside roasted plum and mulberry."
Truchard 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Carneros),Truchard,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$38,85,,"A bit tight. The wine harbors dark berry, licorice and herb flavors. On the finish, it's bright and tangy, smoky and with a touch of bitterness."
McCray Ridge 2000 Two Moon Vineyard Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),McCray Ridge,Red,Two Moon Vineyard,Merlot,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",,$30,89,,"There are some gritty tannins to this wine that make it chewy, almost like a food. It has pretty cherry and blackberry flavors and good acidity that balance the tannins out. Has extra layers of complexity that add interest."
Zolo 2004 Malbec (Mendoza),Zolo,Red,,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.8%,$14,85,Michael Schachner,"Early Middle Eastern aromas of cumin and the like yield to burnt toast and charred hamburger. The palate is perfectly juicy and for the most part balanced, with berry and plum flavors. With pop and ripping acidity, this is a lively number that should go well with burgers, pizza and similar finger foods."
Artadi 2008 Viñas de Gain  (Rioja),Artadi,Red,Viñas de Gain,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,VivinoGary's Wine,91,Michael Schachner,"Tight and edgy but ultimately oaky and generous on the nose, with earth, vanilla, dried cheese and blackberry notes. Feels cushioned and complete, with depth of feel and flavor; tastes of deep berry, mild herbs and finally a toasty wave of coffee and chocolate takes over. Impressive for a 2008; drink now through 2014."
Louis Latour 2011  Clos de Vougeot,Louis Latour,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Clos de Vougeot, Burgundy, France",14%,$280,93,Roger Voss,"The wine has the right weight and power. It comes from a blend of different parcels, bringing out the complexity of the vineyards. Black fruits are soft and generous, supported by tannins as well as licorice and wood flavors. At the end, fresher red fruits show."
Maison Bertrand Ravache 2016 Léo de la Gaffelière Sélection d'Excellence  (Bordeaux),Maison Bertrand Ravache,Red,Léo de la Gaffelière Sélection d'Excellence,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",14%,$16,87,Roger Voss,"A ripe, dense wine with opulent black fruits, this broad wine is dominated by generous Merlot. It is made to be drunk young, even with the backing of tannins, and will be ready from 2020."
Howard Park 2014 Scotsdale Cabernet Sauvignon (Great Southern),Howard Park,Red,Scotsdale,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Great Southern, Western Australia, Australia",14.5%,$37,90,Christina Pickard,"Give this Great Southern Cab some time in glass or decanter to open up, but once it does it reveals notes of cherry cola, cranberry, florals, black pepper and an earthy core. The palate is rich and riding a line between full and medium bodied. It's currently tightly wound, with savory oak tannins that should mellow out with time. Drink now–2027."
Tardieu-Laurent 2010 Vieilles Vignes  (Gigondas),Tardieu-Laurent,Red,Vieilles Vignes,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Gigondas, Rhône Valley, France",14.5%,$45,91,Joe Czerwinski,"Although this wine starts off a bit stern in texture, by the long finish those tannins have turned velvety and plush, nicely framing intense black olive, espresso, cherry and plum flavors. Drink now–2018."
Franchere 2016 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),Franchere,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.8%,$24,87,Paul Gregutt,"Chewy tannins pretty much define this young wine at this point. Bark and skin flavors cover black cherry fruit, and then give way to more astringent, black tea flavors as it finishes. Time may smooth it out a bit, but it's tough to see it really regaining its balance."
Nägelsförst 2016 Klosterbergfelsen Pinot Noir (Baden),Nägelsförst,Red,Klosterbergfelsen,Pinot Noir,"Baden, Germany",13%,,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Alpine notes of wet earth and pine needles lend complexity to luscious black plum and cherry in this silky, medium-bodied wine. Equal parts savory and fruity, it offers sun-kissed cherry flavor calibrated against piquant hits of anise and black pepper spices. Fresh acidity and fine, feathery tannins linger on the finish."
Zantho 2013 Zweigelt (Burgenland),Zantho,Red,,"Zweigelt, Other Red","Burgenland, Austria",13%,$13,90,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Ample blueberry and black cherry fruit is toned by fresh acidity and held in a concentrated body. Little by little the Zweigelt pepperiness creeps in and makes for a punchy, focused red with just the right amount of still perceptible tannins. Great clean finish."
Kessler-Haak 2013 Lafond Vineyard Riesling (Sta. Rita Hills),Kessler-Haak,White,Lafond Vineyard,Riesling,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",13.3%,$20,85,Matt Kettmann,"Typical hints of gasoline on the nose of this wine are bolstered by beeswax, orange blossom water and a steely minerality. The palate is a little flat, with lime pith, lemon juice and very little petrol element."
Machiavelli 2001 Ser Niccolò Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana),Machiavelli,Red,Ser Niccolò,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$35,90,,"Here's a lofty, noble Cab that boasts great power and intensity. The nose is redolent of black plum, spice, green leaf, molasses and a touch of cinnamon. Firm tannins and thick density back its penetrating effect."
Château Tour des Gendres 2012 Merlot-Malbec (Bergerac),Château Tour des Gendres,Red,,"Merlot-Malbec, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Bergerac, Southwest France, France",13.5%,$14,86,Roger Voss,"Soft and fruity, a ripe, medium-bodied wine that has an open structure and good fruitiness. The wine has a background of tannins along with the blackberry fruits and juicy acidity. Drink from 2015."
Leasingham 2004 Bin 7 Riesling (Clare Valley),Leasingham,White,Bin 7,Riesling,"Clare Valley, South Australia, Australia",13%,$15,86,,"A soft and approachable, rather than bracing, Riesling—we probably have the vintage to thank for that. Smells of yellow stone fruit, flowers and white chocolate, and tastes of green grass and stone fruit. Finishes minerally. Imported by Pacific Wine Partners."
Livio Felluga 2000 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Venezia Giulia),Livio Felluga,White,,Pinot Grigio,"Friuli Venezia Giulia, Northeastern Italy, Italy",13%,$21,88,,"This full and tangy Pinot Grigio opens with a subdued orange, mineral and tropical fruit nose. There's a good citrus-herb tension to the palate, and darker and spicier flavors here than usually encountered in Italian versions of the grape. Nicely balanced, the wine has a long, citrus-spice finish."
Scharffenberger NV Brut Excellence Méthode Traditionnelle Sparkling (Mendocino County),Scharffenberger,Sparkling,Brut Excellence Méthode Traditionnelle,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",12%,$18,91,Jim Gordon,"This enticing and supple wine starts with aromas of bread dough and toasted almonds. The palate brings flavors of both fresh and baked apple on a plush, softly sparkling texture."
Sol Rouge 2013 Petite Sirah (Red Hills),Sol Rouge,Red,,Petite Sirah,"Red Hills, Lake County, California, US",14.5%,$45,93,Jim Gordon,"Very dark, very focused, and very pure, this full-bodied wine polishes the notorious tannins of the varietal just slightly, while pouring on dark chocolate, blackberry jam, white pepper and a touch of floral flavor. It's a great wine to buy and stash in a cool place for a few years to see how interesting Petite Sirah can get. Best after 2024."
Alain Jaume et Fils 2006 Domaine Grand Veneur Les Origines Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),Alain Jaume et Fils,Red,Domaine Grand Veneur Les Origines,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rhône Valley, France",15%,$74,94,Joe Czerwinski,"A luxury cuvée at this price is becoming a rarity in Châteauneuf, but Les Origines delivers the goods. Subtle cinnamon and nutmeg shadings frame densely packed black cherry flavors. It's creamy in texture, with a long, velvety finish that lingers elegantly. Drink now–2020."
Rideau 2004 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),Rideau,Red,Sanford & Benedict Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",15.7%,$52,82,,"A thick, young, closed wine with a soft, cloying texture, and jammy fruit and sugared coffee flavors. It's also hot. Might age."
Mitolo 2007 Jester Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),Mitolo,Red,Jester,Cabernet Sauvignon,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$22,86,Joe Czerwinski,"Crisp black cherry and mint aromas burst from the glass, then carry over onto the chunky, authoritative palate before finishing slightly dusty and astringent. This medium-bodied Cabernet features plenty of intensity, it just needs a little time to settle down into a more refined package."
Joseph Drouhin 2011  Chorey-lès-Beaune,Joseph Drouhin,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Chorey-lès-Beaune, Burgundy, France",,$28,84,Roger Voss,"The wine is tight, green and herbal. It has some fruitiness, but that is suppressed by general underripeness. The tannins are hard at the end."
Concannon 2004 Selected Vineyards Merlot (Central Coast),Concannon,Red,Selected Vineyards,Merlot,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",13.4%,$10,81,,"Tastes unripe, with a disagreeably green, minty streak, and although the wine is fully dry, it's just too tough and lean to recommend."
Château Calon Ségur 2015 Le Marquis de Calon Ségur Barrel Sample  (Saint-Estèphe),Château Calon Ségur,Red,Le Marquis de Calon Ségur Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Estèphe, Bordeaux, France",,,93,Roger Voss,"92–94. Barrel Sample. This wine is lightly perfumed from the Cabernet Franc in the blend, which gives it a juicy, fragrant, exotic character. Red fruits and great swathes of acidity sweep through."
Château la Fleur-Pétrus 2017  Pomerol,Château la Fleur-Pétrus,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pomerol, Bordeaux, France",14.5%,,94,Roger Voss,"At 46 acres, this is a large property for Pomerol, adjacent to Château Pétrus. This wine has great richness and acidity, conveying power, density and a hint of spice and perfume from the Cabernet Franc in the blend. Drink this wine from 2023."
Symington Family Estates 2011 Altano Quinta do Ataíde Reserva Red (Douro),Symington Family Estates,Red,Altano Quinta do Ataíde Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Douro, Portugal",,$24,91,Roger Voss,"Still quite closed up, this is going to be a rich wine with great structure. For now, polished wood and stalky red fruits are filled out with fine tannins and a dry, tough core. It's a wine for aging, needing to soften. Drink from 2017."
Orma 2015 Passi di Orma  (Bolgheri),Orma,Red,Passi di Orma,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Bolgheri, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$35,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of black-skinned berry, underbrush and a hint of green olive. The straightforward palate offers vanilla, black-currant jam and a touch of caramel alongside smooth tannins."
Lornano 2013 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Lornano,Red,Riserva,Sangiovese,"Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,$30,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of underbrush, cedar and black-skinned berry. The chewy palate delivers blackberry jam, licorice, black pepper and coffee alongside fine-grained tannins. Enjoy now through 2024."
Château Poitevin 2016  Médoc,Château Poitevin,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Médoc, Bordeaux, France",13%,$19,88,Roger Voss,"This wine's spicy aromas indicate the considerable wood aging that shows strongly. However, the good news is that there is also plenty of ripe blackberry fruit that will develop well as the wine ages. Give this well-structured wine until 2022 before drinking."
Quivira 2005 Wine Creek Ranch Grenache (Dry Creek Valley),Quivira,Red,Wine Creek Ranch,Grenache,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.8%,$24,91,,"Quivira produces interesting, often compelling red wines year after year. A Rhône pioneer, their '05 Grenache is far more subtle and elegant than most California bottlings. The powerful red cherry fruit has a spicy edge, while the tannic structure is ripe and layered. A polished wine."
Au Bon Climat 2010 Historic Vineyards Collection Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),Au Bon Climat,Red,Historic Vineyards Collection Bien Nacido Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$40,96,,"This Pinot Noir is insanely delicious. The wine is dry, tart and moderate in alcohol, giving it the smooth silkiness you want in a fine Pinot. The flavors are something else, striking the perfect balance between ripe raspberries, earthy cola, red licorice and mushrooms, with all kinds of spicy complexities. The acid-tannin balance is impeccable. It's drinking beautifully now and should hold and change in the bottle over the next eight years."
Château la Fon du Berger 2015 Cru Bourgeois  (Haut-Médoc),Château la Fon du Berger,Red,Cru Bourgeois,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Haut-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",13%,$26,89,Roger Voss,"Dark chocolate and rich tannins are strong elements in this mature wine. Dark fruits have softened into the structure, hinting at blackberries but more focused on secondary flavors. Drink now."
Château de Piote 2010  Bordeaux,Château de Piote,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",13%,$22,85,Roger Voss,"Firmly tannic, this is still a young wine. It has a dry structure with a black currant-skin stalkiness. Acidity and structure are still developing, so wait until 2016."
Firriato 2007 Quater Red (Sicilia),Firriato,Red,Quater,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",14.5%,$32,90,,"Quater is a rich red blend that opens with blackberry, rum cake, Indian spice, cola and ground clove.

Figgins 2013 Estate Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Figgins,Red,Estate,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.7%,$85,93,Sean P. Sullivan,"This blend offers beguiling, complex aromas of violets, scorched earth, cassis, black licorice and graphite. The flavors are tightly wound, showing poise and presence. It drinks well out of the gate but cellaring will be particularly rewarded. Best from 2022 through 2030."
Villa Spinosa 2001  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Villa Spinosa,Red,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara, Italian Red","Amarone della Valpolicella Classico, Veneto, Italy",16%,$55,88,,"This 2001 vintage Amarone shows elegant signs of age with aromas of old spice, dried fruit, dried porcini mushroom and pressed rose petal. It's a bit tired and flat in the mouth at this point, so if you have a bottle drink it soon."
Margan 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon (Hunter Valley),Margan,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia",14.5%,$15,82,,"Faux-creaminess pervades nose and palate flavors, though I'm not convinced that what's underneath is necessarily worth fighting for. The bouquet offers soil, juicy berry and watermelon aromas; tart black fruit peeks out from under the palate's creamy cloak."
Château Haut Selve 2009  Graves,Château Haut Selve,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Graves, Bordeaux, France",13.5%,$25,90,Roger Voss,"This wine exhibits the generosity from the ripe 2009 vintage. It has rich, full and round fruits, with a pleasing black currant flavor and tannic edge. Juicy, with a dust-textured aftertaste, this will age for 4–5 years."
Castle Rock 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County),Castle Rock,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa County, Napa, California, US",13.5%,$16,81,,"A dreary, simple wine, as thin as water with a few drops of blackberry syrup. It's also soft and bitter on the finish."
Golan Heights Winery 2008 Yarden Heights Wine Kosher - 375 ml Gewürztraminer (Galilee),Golan Heights Winery,Dessert,Yarden Heights Wine Kosher - 375 ml,Gewürztraminer,"Galilee, Israel",12%,$23,89,Lauren Buzzeo,"Rich and alluring with notes of ripe stone fruit, baked apple and a drizzle of chestnut honey throughout. Full and viscous in the mouth but lifted by crisp acidity that follows through to the clean but long finish."
Oxford Landing 2018 Shiraz (South Australia),Oxford Landing,Red,,,"South Australia, South Australia, Australia",13.5%,$10,83,Christina Pickard,"Pale in color, this watery Shiraz initially offers some bright cherry fruit but quickly slides into synthetic territory with a dish soap and oak spice quality. The palate is thin and astringent, and the fruit falls rapidly flat, finishing on the sour side."
Lieubeau 2017 Domaine de la Fruitière Gneiss de Bel Abord Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),Lieubeau,White,Domaine de la Fruitière Gneiss de Bel Abord Sur Lie,"Melon de Bourgogne, Other White","Muscadet Sèvre et Maine, Loire Valley, France",12%,$18,90,Roger Voss,"The schist and granite soil of this vineyard yields a wine that is strongly mineral. Its acidity and fruitiness are restrained by a tense texture and steely character. This fine wine needs to age a few more months, so drink from early 2019."
Beaucanon 2002 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Beaucanon,White,,Chardonnay,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$15,84,,"A little earthy, with creamy apple sauce flavors dusted with cinnamon and nutmeg, but dry. There's a rough texture through the finish."
Coelho 2016 Coelho Estates Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Coelho,White,Coelho Estates,,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",10.5%,$23,85,Paul Gregutt,"This is the most expensive of Coelho's three Pinot Gris offerings and also the least ripe. Bone-dry, sour and thin, it seems to improve when paired with fresh oysters."
Romantic 2014 Authentic &amp; Chic Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),Romantic,Red,Authentic & Chic,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vin de France, France Other, France",,$10,86,Lauren Buzzeo,"The medium-intense nose of this solid and easy-to-like Cab offers scents of blackberry, cassis and plum, all laced by hints of cocoa and cigar box. The medium-weight mouth offers a pleasant texture, thanks to moderate tannins and ample acidity, with solid black-fruit flavors at the core."
State of Art 2011 Red (Monterey County),State of Art,Red,,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",14.7%,$20,81,,"This blend of Syrah and Grenache is hard and tough, with stringy, dry tannins and flavors of vegetables and cherry cough syrup. Lots of new French oak does little to make it more palatable."
Barth René 2003 Vignoble de Bennwihr Pinot Gris (Alsace),Barth René,White,Vignoble de Bennwihr,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12%,$17,85,,"Ginger and tonic water on the nose, with pear, apple and sweet melon flavors. Seems a touch off-dry, with licorice and candy on the finish. Spunky but feminine in style. Imported by Atlanta Improvement Co."
Tin Barn 2016 Pickberry Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),Tin Barn,Red,Pickberry Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$38,88,Virginie Boone,"This is an herbaceous and thickly dense wine from the famous site, a study in mountain forest, sage and savory tobacco. The fruit is red and tart, integrating well within the wine's balance of power and grace."
Andriano 2012 Movado Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige),Andriano,White,Movado,Gewürztraminer,"Alto Adige, Northeastern Italy, Italy",15%,$48,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"This wine opens with an intense bouquet of white roses with accents of baking spices. The flowery sensation carries over to the palate along with ripe banana, pear and clove, plus the heat of alcohol. It concludes with a slightly sweet finish."
Lomas del Valle 2012 Coast Cool Climate Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),Lomas del Valle,Red,Coast Cool Climate,Pinot Noir,"Casablanca Valley, Chile",14.5%,$17,86,Michael Schachner,"Piercing sour raspberry aromas introduce an edgy, scratchy feeling wine with a combo of minty, herbal pie cherry and red plum flavors. This dries out and finishes modestly, but always with true Pinot Noir character."
Laird 2013 Mast Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Laird,Red,Mast Ranch,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.8%,$80,90,Virginie Boone,"This vineyard designate from Yountville is packed with compact tannin and rich oak yet nicely balanced by crisp ranberry, cherry and clove flavors. Light black-pepper notes add seasoning."

Iijima,"Delicate but perfumed, this deft, sprightly Riesling offers rich, concentrated pink grapefruit and white peach flavors etched by lime and steel. It's a juicy, thirst-quenching wine that's gobs of fun to drink young but should continue to drink beautifully through 2029."

Behind the steely texture, it is fruity as well, with tight apple and strong citrus flavors. It's a tense and nervy style with depth of flavor and concentration. This is 100% Chardonnay harvested in 2011 from Oger grand cru vineyards in the Côte des Blancs. Drink now, although it will age and round out in bottle through 2015 at least."
Farnese 2007  Trebbiano d'Abruzzo,Farnese,White,,"Trebbiano, Italian White","Trebbiano d'Abruzzo, Central Italy, Italy",12%,$9,85,,"This well-priced white wine is simple and clean with fruit-driven aromas of peach, melon and honey. You can taste sweet notes from the strong sunshine and the wine has good density and firmness throughout."
Labouré-Roi 2010 Les Sangliers Pinot Noir (Pays d'Oc),Labouré-Roi,Red,Les Sangliers,Pinot Noir,"Pays d'Oc, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",13%,$12,85,Lauren Buzzeo,"The fruit isn't the star of this wine; instead, intense notes of forest floor and cola spice dominate the nose and palate. Sure, the red berry and cherry flavors are there, but they're just hanging in the background of this bright yet herbaceous selection."
Merry Edwards 2014 Olivet Lane Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Merry Edwards,Red,Olivet Lane,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.4%,$68,94,Virginie Boone,"This is from one of the oldest Pinot Noir vineyards in the area, owned and farmed by Bob Pellegrini, and a place that has provided grapes Edwards since the 1980s. Spicy pine and cardamom greet the nose and palate, as silky smooth layers of rose and wild strawberry meet cardamon and vanilla. Medium-bodied, it remains complex and balanced as it develops additional nuance in the glass."
Mansfield-Dunne 2017 Peterson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Mansfield-Dunne,Red,Peterson Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.2%,$48,92,Matt Kettmann,"Full and pleasantly rustic aromas of cherry, cranberry, sagebrush, roasted game and crushed gravel show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling. The palate is also savory and full of intriguing flavors, showing roasted pork in mulberry and cranberry sauce with a pinch of oregano."
Oakford 1996 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Oakford,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",,$75,92,,"Has the usual mid-Napa aromas of cassis, smoke and oak. Flavors are similar, ripe and fruity, verging on jammy. But the tannins are ultrasoft and creamy, yet complex and lacy. Provides sheer pleasure now or you can age it. From consulting winemaker Heidi Barrett."
Stonestreet 2007 Legacy Red (Alexander Valley),Stonestreet,Red,Legacy,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.8%,$85,91,,"Dramatically rich and full-bodied in blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate and oak flavors. With thick, fine tannins giving it a youthful astringency, this Bordeaux blend needs to be cellared. Should develop bottle notes over the next ten years."
Bedell 2014 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),Bedell,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"North Fork of Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",12.5%,$45,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Plummy blackberry and cherry flavors abound in this Cabernet Franc, anchored by a taut frame of fine, firm tannins and cranberry acidity. It seems lavishly oaked, but pronounced aromas of cedar and toast integrate smoothly on the palate. The long finish is marked by an enticing pencil-shaving edge."
Townshend 2001 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Townshend,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$24,88,Paul Gregutt,"Excellent varietal character and definition. This is the most firm and tannic of Townshend's lineup, an earthy, slightly chalky wine. The fruit is clean and well-delineated, with grace notes of coffee and coconut; just not quite as lingering as its siblings."
Domaine Carneros 2019 Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),Domaine Carneros,Red,Estate,Pinot Noir,"Carneros, Napa-Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$44,90,Virginie Boone,"Dark fruit and soft, supple texture define this estate wine, silky and complete with the appellation's signature funk. Rose-petal aromatics, black-tea and forest notes provide varietal beauty and complexity."
Michel Picard 1997 Domaine Voarick  (Beaune),Michel Picard,Red,Domaine Voarick,Pinot Noir,"Beaune, Burgundy, France",13%,,84,,"Shows full cherry, licorice, leather and barnyardy notes on the nose. Some sour cherry and raspberry flavors, with sly oak and chocolate accents; a slightly creamy mouthfeel and a medium-long mineral and herb finish. Again, good elements, but the total effect is curiously less than the sum of the parts."
Il Marroneto 2013 Madonna delle Grazie  (Brunello di Montalcino),Il Marroneto,Red,Madonna delle Grazie,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$224,95,Kerin O’Keefe,"Earthy aromas of underbrush, truffle, game and new leather meld with ripe berry and a whiff of blue flower. Reflecting the nose, the savory palate is loaded with personality, delivering crushed raspberry, black cherry, clove, aromatic herb and a distinct but intriguing gamy note alongside a backbone of assertive, fine-grained tannins. Vibrant acidity lends balance. Open this way in advance to give it time to breathe. Drink 2023–2038."
Tamayo Family 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Tamayo Family,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.2%,$30,87,,"Here's a rich, densely layered Cab. It's showing complex flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and cedar. The tannins are a little edgy, giving the wine an astringent bite that could mellow out with mid-term aging."
Waters 2006 Loess Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Waters,Red,Loess Vineyard,,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$40,92,Paul Gregutt,"This Loess is definitely more—more concentration, more ripeness, more Côte Rôtie character than the 2005, but already showing dramatic flavor development. Cofermented with 3% Viognier, it's a silky wine with flavors of blood, meat and earth dominating. Tannins are ripe, and it was barreled in second-fill oak, preserving the natural flavors of the vineyard. Clearly the best so far from Waters."
Château Langrange Monbadon 2010  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,Château Langrange Monbadon,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",,$15,85,Roger Voss,"A softly juicy wine, this is missing structure while it has plenty of fruit. It's ripe, rich and juicy; a pleasure to drink in 2–3 years."
Foxen 7200 2012 7200 Vogelzang Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),Foxen 7200,Red,7200 Vogelzang Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California, US",14.7%,$54,93,Matt Kettmann,"Winemaker Billy Wathen is steadily perfecting this appellation, and this wine shows blackberry, black pepper and roast beef crust on the nose. A very savory and interesting palate mixes Bing cherries and dried berries with peppered beef jerky, oregano and even roasted garlic, making for an elegant and delicious wine."
Glenora 2016 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),Glenora,White,,,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12%,$15,86,Alexander Peartree,"Shy aromas of citrus and apple blend with a light plastic tone. This is slick in feel, with green apple and pear holding court, ending on a crunchy apple peel tone."
Joseph Cellars 2015 Ramazzotti Vineyard Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),Joseph Cellars,Red,Ramazzotti Vineyard,Petite Sirah,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",15.5%,$65,90,Virginie Boone,"Dusty tannins are at the center of this boldly ripe, brawny wine, which offers soft plush texture and a depth of rich plum. Dark chocolate waves are complemented by a savory twist of cigar box and pepper."
Wilkens Family 2018 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Wilkens Family,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",11.6%,$70,91,Paul Gregutt,"This is the reserve label for Abbey Road Farm. It's a two-barrel selection from the same sources as the regular Pinot Noir; one barrel was new. Supple dark fruits, along with a slightly bitter streak of barrel toast, give the cherry flavors a sort of charred character. The wine is in good shape for near-term drinking, with medium length and balance. Decanting first is recommended to soften the barrel impact."
Feudo Arancio 2010 Stemmari Cabernet Sauvignon (Sicilia),Feudo Arancio,Red,Stemmari,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13.5%,$10,87,,"If you are staging an informal outdoor barbecue with franks and burgers, this value wine will meet all your pairing needs. It's soft, plush and round, with exotic spice, ripe fruit and black pepper."
Koves-Newlan 1999 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),Koves-Newlan,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$20,87,,"Everything about this wine is designed to flatter the palate, from the cherry and black raspberry fruit, dusted with dry crushed spices, to the overlay of richly toasted oak, to the soft, yielding tannins. What's not to like? It ain't grand cru Burgundy, but it sure is nice drinking. —S.H."
Osborne 2003 Vintage  (Port),Osborne,Port/Sherry,Vintage,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",,$50,84,Roger Voss,"A disappointing Port from a firm that is better known for its Sherries and brandies. The fruit is highly perfumed, with aromas of geraniums, but is not at all structured. Instead, it is much more in a light, fresh style."
Morandé 2001 Grand Reserve Vitisterra Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Morandé,Red,Grand Reserve Vitisterra,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Maipo Valley, Chile",13%,$13,88,Michael Schachner,"Quite condensed and woody, with brier and sawdust aromas and some vivacious berry fruit. The palate is deep and pure, with cherry and cassis along with hints of coffee and earth. Yes, it's a bit hard due to firm tannins, but it's also a complete wine with a long, overt finish. Best Buy."
The Walls 2014 Wonderful Nightmare Stoney Vine Vineyard Tempranillo (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),The Walls,Red,Wonderful Nightmare Stoney Vine Vineyard,Tempranillo,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.07%,$42,86,Sean P. Sullivan,"Light in color, intriguing aromas of cedar, mushroom, orange peel, smoke and cigar box are followed by somewhat faint elegantly styled red-fruit and spice flavors. It falls a bit flat on the palate."
Roccafiore 2014  Montefalco Sagrantino,Roccafiore,Red,,"Sagrantino, Italian Red","Montefalco Sagrantino, Central Italy, Italy",15%,$27,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of steeped plum and baking spice and a whiff of rose lift out of the glass. Round and concentrated, the full-bodied, enveloping palate doles out fleshy black cherry, blackberry jam and cinnamon alongside close-grained, dusty tannins. Drink through 2026."
Château Julien 2001 Barrel Aged Pinot Grigio (Monterey County),Château Julien,White,Barrel Aged,Pinot Grigio,"Monterey County, Central Coast, California, US",13%,$10,84,,"Fruity and simple, a wine that will give pleasure if you're not looking for complexities. Peaches, melons and figs, a little sweet, a bit soft."
Henschke 2005 Louis Semillon (Eden Valley),Henschke,White,Louis,"Sémillon, Sémillon","Eden Valley, South Australia, Australia",13%,$27,90,Joe Czerwinski,"Henschke is best known for its red wines, but the 2005 Louis Sémillon shows they know a thing or two about whites as well. It combines some toasty, smoky characters with herbal notes on the nose, then develops flavors of wax, spice and citrus, lingering elegantly on the finish. Tasty now, but might develop even more interesting complexities with additional age."
Quinta do Vale Meão 2017 Monte Meão Vinha da Cantina Baga (Douro),Quinta do Vale Meão,Red,Monte Meão Vinha da Cantina,"Baga, Portuguese Red","Douro, Portugal",12%,$49,90,Roger Voss,"It is unusual to find the Bairrada grape, Baga, in the Douro. This single-vineyard wine shows the grape's natural tannic character along with black currant acidity. The wine is in need of some aging. Drink from 2023."
Collovray et Terrier 2012 Les Vignes de Joanny  (Mâcon-Davayé),Collovray et Terrier,White,Les Vignes de Joanny,Chardonnay,"Mâcon-Davayé, Burgundy, France",13.5%,$23,86,Roger Voss,"A tight, mineral-driven wine, it has both great fruit and acidity. It is tangy, pushing forward crisp lemon and apple skin flavors and a touch of peach. Drink now."
Black Kite 2010 Stony Terrace Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Black Kite,Red,Stony Terrace,Pinot Noir,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14.6%,$55,94,Virginie Boone,"More subtle at first than the 2010 River Turn, Stony Terrace, another of Black Kite's yearly single-block designates, is earthy, savory and dense. Mouth filling in its juicy red and blue fruit flavor, it's silky and entirely seductive. Well integrated and structured, it's another fine choice for the table and for cellaring another 5–7 years."
Il Cascinone 2014 Rive  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),Il Cascinone,Red,Rive,Barbera,"Barbera d'Asti Superiore, Piedmont, Italy",14%,$19,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Ripe black-skinned berry and black plum aromas take center stage in this wine, along with a whiff of toast. The dense palate shows black cherry, licorice and mocha touches framed by firm tannins. Drink through 2020."
Decugnano dei Barbi 2013 Villa Barbi  (Orvieto Classico),Decugnano dei Barbi,White,Villa Barbi,White Blend,"Orvieto Classico, Central Italy, Italy",12.5%,$17,88,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of stone fruit, wildflower and Bartlett pear come together in the glass. The savory palate doles out juicy green apple, creamy white peach and aromatic herb, while fresh acidity and a light mineral vein give it a clean, crisp finish."
Badabing 2008 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),Badabing,Red,,"Nero d'Avola, Italian Red","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",12.5%,,85,,"Badabing shoots forward simple fruit tones of cherry, raspberry and cranberry that wash clean over the palate. Pair this wine with simple pasta or pizza; it's an easy-drinking, no-fuss red."
Dominus 2001 Estate Bottled Red (Napa Valley),Dominus,Red,Estate Bottled,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.1%,$109,94,,"As good as the 2001 Napanook is, this wine is more intense. The fruit is lusher, the oak newer, the control more complete, but the kicker is the tannins. They're powerful and dusty, and conceal the flamboyance, for now. Needs time; hold until 2010 and beyond."
Setzer 2005 Kreimelberg Roter Veltliner (Niederösterreich),Setzer,White,Kreimelberg,"Roter Veltliner, Other White","Niederösterreich, Austria",,$21,88,Roger Voss,A relatively rare varietal that is believed to originate in the Krems region. This example shows the varietal's high acidity that needs an off-dry flavor to compensate. It has a nice caramel layer which helps in the balance.
Guicciardini Strozzi 2011 Sòdole Sangiovese (Toscana),Guicciardini Strozzi,Red,Sòdole,Sangiovese,"Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$50,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of scorched soil, used leather and game. The aromas follow over to the funky palate along with mature plum and black pepper. It's already accessible, with evolved tannins. Enjoy soon."
Quinta Essentia 2015 Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),Quinta Essentia,White,,Chenin Blanc,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",14%,$40,91,Lauren Buzzeo,"This is a well-balanced and attractive pour, with scents of orange blossom, lemon verbena, quinine and lime that frame the just-ripe peach and melon fruit core. A pithy astringency provides a subtle texture to the palate and lends some lingering grip to the finish, coupled with a vibrant acidity that leaves you read for more. Drink now–2022."
Dios Ares 2011 Reserva  (Rioja),Dios Ares,Red,Reserva,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$23,89,Michael Schachner,"Very familiar Rioja aromas of cherry, plum and prune scream Tempranillo. This is wiry in feel, with tight, hammering acidity. Berry and black-cherry flavors finish on a subtle note of chocolate along with a final shot of juicy, sharp acidity."
Virage 2010 Rosé (Napa Valley),Virage,Rose,,Rosé,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",13.3%,$24,88,,"This blush wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. As you'd expect, it's a big wine for a rosé, a little heavy, but there's a nice cut of acidity that helps. Is it dry? Sort of, with a jammy finish of black raspberries. Try this easy-drinking wine with grilled tuna or a hamburger."
Donna Olga 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,Donna Olga,Red,,Sangiovese,"Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$50,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"Intense underbrush aromas, black berries and baking spices lead the nose on this wine. The dense palate offers up juicy wild cherry, black pepper and cinnamon-spice alongside solid but velvety tannins. It's well balanced and already shows depth but hold for complexity. Drink 2016–2021."
Jeff Cohn 2016 Broken Compass Saitone Vineyard Old Vine Carignane (Russian River Valley),Jeff Cohn,Red,Broken Compass Saitone Vineyard Old Vine,"Carignane, Carignan","Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",15.2%,$45,90,Virginie Boone,"From a well-known old-vine site for Zinfandel, this wine shows the prowess of other varieties within its ground. Thick, leathery and tart, it retains plenty of acidity within a core of full-powered earth and stems. The richness is complemented by seasonings of white and black pepper."
Vigne di Mezzo 2004 Efesto  (Aglianico del Vulture),Vigne di Mezzo,Red,Efesto,"Aglianico, Italian Red","Aglianico del Vulture, Southern Italy, Italy",13.5%,$41,91,,"Here is a very likable Aglianico del Vulture with bright spice flavors, big concentration and black fruit. The wine is dark and impenetrable with thick tannins and chewy succulence."
Château de Fieuzal 2010  Pessac-Léognan,Château de Fieuzal,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,,93,Roger Voss,"This is a fine, beautifully controlled wine. Its dark black currant fruits and firm dense texture are restrained, stylish and delicious. At the same time, the fruits offer a smooth, juicy aftertaste. Keep for 6–7 years."
Château la Fleur Peyrabon 2013  Pauillac,Château la Fleur Peyrabon,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France",12.5%,$22,89,Roger Voss,"A small portion of Château Peyrabon lies in the Pauillac appellation and is vinified separately. This is a surprisingly light wine for its appellation, fresh with fruitiness rather than structured. It has attractive black-currant acidity and a core of smoky tannins. Drink from 2018."
Kuentz-Bas 2018 Trois Châteaux Pinot Gris (Alsace),Kuentz-Bas,White,Trois Châteaux,,"Alsace, Alsace, France",14%,$30,90,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The shy nose on this wine keeps its secrets for now, showing only a hint of ripe pear. The palate comes in with the subtle richness of baked pear, freshness and gentle spice. A mellow fruit balance gives roundness and texture. The finish is off dry and bright."
Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg 2013 Furstentum Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg,White,Furstentum Grand Cru,"Gewürztraminer, Gewürztraminer","Alsace, Alsace, France",13%,$28,90,Roger Voss,"This wine is ripe, full while also fresh. A rounded character gains texture from the dry spiciness of nutmeg and pepper. Acidity holds this wine together and gives it fine potential. Drink from 2017."
Muga 2007 Barrel Fermented Viura (Rioja),Muga,White,Barrel Fermented,"Viura, Spanish White","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$17,87,Michael Schachner,"Muga has crafted a steely, no-fat Viura (with 10% Malvasia), despite the wine being fermented in barrel. The nose is clean and passive, while the palate is crisp and tight but largely neutral in its delivery of apple and lemon flavors. From a cool vintage, this wine is like kissing the razor's edge. Good stuff but limited in what it has in store."
Il Nuraghe 2000 San Bernardino  (Monica di Sardegna),Il Nuraghe,Red,San Bernardino,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Monica di Sardegna, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",13%,$15,83,Michael Schachner,"Very cheesy in the nose, and that scent of English cheddar just won't go away. Otherwise, the wine has some starchy tannins propping up stewy plum and blackberry flavors. The finish of bitter chocolate and molasses is heavy and lacking in purity."
Blue Farm 2017 Laceroni Vineyard Estate Farmed Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Blue Farm,White,Laceroni Vineyard Estate Farmed,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.7%,$70,94,Virginie Boone,"This is a profusely complex, floral and mineral-driven white wine, gorgeously crafted to exhibit deft layers of Bosc pear, Gravenstein apple and lemon peel. Pronounced oak and tannin speak to its youth more than its style, leaving a weighty imprint of barrel and clove on the finish."
Shannon Ridge 2016 High Elevation Collection Chardonnay (Lake County),Shannon Ridge,White,High Elevation Collection,Chardonnay,"Lake County, Lake County, California, US",13.8%,$23,87,Jim Gordon,"This full-bodied wine smells quite fruity and buttery, and tastes lush and ripe. It has plenty of vanilla, butterscotch, ripe pear and cream notes along with a texture so broad that it's almost sweet on the tongue."
Estancia 2007 Shiraz (Central Coast),Estancia,Red,,,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$12,87,,"Dark, bone dry and tannic, a full-bodied wine whose tartness and astringency call for rich fare, like beef stew. Shows deeply ripe flavors of blackberries, cassis, bitter dark chocolate and black pepper that are enlivened with brisk acidity."
Tolosa 2006 1772 Edna Ranch Chardonnay (Edna Valley),Tolosa,White,1772 Edna Ranch,Chardonnay,"Edna Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.8%,$42,92,,"Very rich in oak and ripe fruit, with kiwi, lime, pineapple and fig flavors that finish crisp and dry. The oak really stands out with its blast of buttered toast, caramel and woodspice."
Mirassou 2001 Merlot (California),Mirassou,Red,,Merlot,"California, California Other, California, US",,$10,83,,"Seems a trifle raisiny, with dark, plummy notes that come across as sun-baked rather than fresh. Still, it offers a mouthful of fruit and a nice, plump texture."
Robert Mondavi 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Robert Mondavi,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",15%,$45,89,,"Shows everything that's noble about Oakville, from the wonderful, dusty tannins to the dryness and overall balance. Lovely, with flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. Could have more depth, though."
Sineann 2003 Pinot Noir (Oregon),Sineann,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Oregon, Oregon Other, Oregon, US",,$30,92,Paul Gregutt,"The best Oregon bottling ever from this exceptional producer. Spectacular, ripe, plush aromatics open into plummy, jammy, purely varietal fruit. But there is more, a textural complexity that incorporates light herb, leaf and vanilla notes. This has it all, and offers every bit as much pleasure as any of the single-vineyard bottlings."
Aperture 2019 Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg),Aperture,White,,Chenin Blanc,"Clarksburg, Central Valley, California, US",13.1%,$30,89,Jim Gordon,"This exciting wine is crisp and tangy, full of vivid fruit flavors like kiwi, lime and green apple. Good acidity gives it a lively, appetizing mouthfeel."
Kendall-Jackson 2001 Stature Meritage (Napa Valley),Kendall-Jackson,Red,Stature,"Meritage, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$120,93,,"Already bottled, this wine isn't scheduled to be released until March 2005. If you like your Cabs big, rich and chewy (and who doesn't?) it's never to early to start badgering your retailer or wholesaler to try to get you some of the 613 cases produced. Toasty notes accent dark chocolate and plum scents, while intense cassis flavors fill the mouth. Sturdy; try after 2006."
Château Vrai Caillou 2018  Bordeaux,Château Vrai Caillou,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",12.5%,$20,87,Roger Voss,"Bottled without added sulfur, this wine is a blend made primarily with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. This mix gives a perfumed character to the juicy fruits. The tannins need to soften before the wine is ready to drink so wait until 2021."
Scheid 2019 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),Scheid,White,Estate Grown,Sauvignon Blanc,"Monterey, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$22,89,Matt Kettmann,"Aromas of green pear, lime peel and lawn clippings show on the zesty nose of this bottling. There's a fresh and easy energy to the palate, where green apple peel, red apple and guava flavors slide into the finish."
Cascina Luisin 2010 del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba Leon  (Barolo),Cascina Luisin,Red,del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba Leon,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",,$75,94,Kerin O’Keefe,"Black plum, fleshy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper, leather, sage, cinnamon and balsamic sensations are all woven together. It's nicely balanced with firm but fine tannins and brisk acidity, closing on a licorice note. Best after 2020."
Pessagno 2006 Lucia Highlands Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Pessagno,Red,Lucia Highlands Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.4%,$28,92,,"Here's a savory, delicious and varietally true Pinor Noir that drinks well right away, but has the structural integrity for the cellar. With crisp, dry flavors of cherries, pomegranates, cola, tobacco and Chinese five-spice, it appeals for its exotic immediacy, but has the density to evolve for 5 or 6 years."
Tero Estates 2007 Windrow Vineyards Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),Tero Estates,Red,Windrow Vineyards Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Walla Walla Valley (OR), Oregon Other, Oregon, US",14.8%,$90,95,Paul Gregutt,"This is superstrong Cabernet Sauvignon, with precise, concentrated flavors of brambly old-vine fruit taking center stage. The wine spent 33 months in barrel and has the density and power to prove it."
Bennett Lane 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Bennett Lane,Red,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$95,90,,"Tons of fresh, succulent cherry and raspberry fruit flavors in this savory wine, elaborated with sweet, smoky oak. Made in a drink-me-now style, it's soft and lush, with beautifully ripe, smooth tannins."
Carmel 2004 Kayoumi Single Vineyard Kosher Cabernet Sauvignon (Upper Galilee),Carmel,Red,Kayoumi Single Vineyard Kosher,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Upper Galilee, Israel",13.5%,$39,85,Lauren Buzzeo,"The acidity is strong and quite forward in this wine, both in the mouth and on the nose. Red berry preserves and a faint cocoa dusting flesh out the medium-weight mouth, with grainy tannins lingering through the finish."
Weinert 2006 Merlot (Mendoza),Weinert,Red,,Merlot,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$25,90,Michael Schachner,"While this smells directly from the Old World, it's appealing and unique in style for Argentina. For starters, it's mature, bordering on old. Because of vital acidity, it's in good shape, with stewed berry, tobacco, spice and chocolate flavors. On the finish, pepper and bitter coffee notes enter the picture. Drink this one-of-a-kind Merlot now."
Elk Cove 2006 Five Mountain Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Elk Cove,Red,Five Mountain,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,VivinoWine.com,90,Paul Gregutt,"Five Mountain is the newest addition to Elk Cove's single-vineyard portfolio, and it stands apart with sharp, spicy, pine resin highlights dotted with cranberry fruit. Tomato leaf and savory spices pile on through the finish; this is distinctive and well-crafted, though a bit off the mainstream Oregon style."
Château Magnol 2016  Haut-Médoc,Château Magnol,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Haut-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",13%,$30,90,Roger Voss,"This richly fruity wine comes from the southern part of the Haut-Médoc, close to the city of Bordeaux. Its density and concentration give it the ability to age. With its black fruits and ripe tannins, it will likely be ready to drink from 2022."
Château Tour des Gendres 2015 Les Anciens Francs Parcelle A252 Cabernet Franc (Côtes de Bergerac),Château Tour des Gendres,Red,Les Anciens Francs Parcelle A252,Cabernet Franc,"Côtes de Bergerac, Southwest France, France",14.5%,$50,93,Roger Voss,"A smoky perfume marks this young wine immediately as Cabernet Franc. Its ripe blackberry and juicy black currant flavors give it richness, while tannins come through strongly. It's a powerful, solid wine, with great potential. Drink from 2020."
Emina 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Rueda),Emina,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Rueda, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$18,87,Michael Schachner,"Round, chunky aromas of grapefruit and passion fruit settle on friendly and varietally correct. This is snappy and solid in feel, with lime, orange and nectarine flavors. An acid-driven finish holds the line and doesn't taste bitter or green."
Estampa 2004 Reserve Assemblage Syrah Red (Colchagua Valley),Estampa,Red,Reserve Assemblage Syrah,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Colchagua Valley, Chile",14%,$12,88,Michael Schachner,"Dark and just a touch herbal and green on the nose, but overall it's a pretty, beefy blend of Syrah (60%), Cabernet and Merlot that should win over even the most discerning of critics. The palate is balanced and features a rich, comfortable feel. And the finish is crisp but also long and rewarding. For $12 there's not much you can gripe about."

It's smooth and easygoing in the mouth and would pair with grilled sausage or lamb chops.
Boomtown 2008 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),Boomtown,White,,Chardonnay,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$13,90,Paul Gregutt,"Stainless steel fermented, this pure varietal is bursting with a tasty fruit bowl mix of apple, pineapple, and Meyer lemon. A hint of mint sneaks in, and the acidity brings bracing minerality to the finish."
Cinnabar 2008 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Cinnabar,Red,Sleepy Hollow Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$42,86,,"Opens with an ashy smell that mostly blows off if you give it a few moments to breathe. Afterwards, it's tough in acids and tannins, lacking generosity, although there's a good core of black cherry fruit."
Vinícola Miolo 2005 Family Vineyards Merlot (Vale dos Vinhedos),Vinícola Miolo,Red,Family Vineyards,Merlot,,13.5%,$10,85,Michael Schachner,"If you're ready to jump head-first into the emerging but sketchy realm of Brazilian table wine, then Merlot is a good place to start. This one has baked, earthy aromas of clay, spice and leather. The palate is fruity and saturated, with deep cherry, berry, coffee and prune flavors. Good in its class. Imported by GM Miolo, USA."
Marqués de Murrieta 2011 Capellanía Viura (Rioja),Marqués de Murrieta,White,Capellanía,"Viura, Spanish White","Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$29,92,Michael Schachner,"Waxy aromas of dried stone fruits and potent oak open this classy barrel-fermented Viura. A refined palate with cutting acidity energizes woody pear and apple flavors. On the finish, resiny oak and a wave of oxidized Sherry notes are highly complex but maybe not for everyone."
Château La Rose du Pin 2011  Bordeaux,Château La Rose du Pin,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",12.5%,$13,84,Roger Voss,"The wine is rounded and soft with attractive berry fruits and wood aging.

Beauregard 2013 Beaureagard Ranch Chardonnay (Ben Lomond Mountain),Beauregard,White,Beaureagard Ranch,Chardonnay,"Ben Lomond Mountain, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$50,93,Matt Kettmann,"There's a warm peach ripeness on the nose of this wine from a tiny appellation north of Santa Cruz near Bonny Doon, along with aromas of kumquat, vanilla bean and sea salt. The palate shows more peach, caramelized apples and saffron, cut with a lime-juice acidity and finishing with a dollop of vanilla-butter."
Elena Walch 2011 Beyond the Clouds White (Alto Adige),Elena Walch,White,Beyond the Clouds,White Blend,"Alto Adige, Northeastern Italy, Italy",14%,$65,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"Oak extract dominates the nose on this wine together with aromas of Golden Delicous apple and lemon zest. The palate offers lemon, oak, vanilla and clove, but it lacks the fruit richness needed to support the oak."

The flavors are jammy with superripe purple fruit, lifted by brown spice and black pepper."

Iron Horse 2006 Brut X Sparkling (Green Valley),Iron Horse,Sparkling,Brut X,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Green Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,VivinoGary's Wine,89,,"This is one of Iron Horse's drier wines, with a low dosage, but it's still fairly sweet. There's a coating of sugar on the raspberries, oranges and limes. The bubbles are a bit scoury now, but this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend could develop nuances in the cellar after, say, 2013."
Rock Wall 2011 Romancer-Heringer Vineyard Red (Clarksburg),Rock Wall,Red,Romancer-Heringer Vineyard,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Clarksburg, Central Valley, California, US",12.8%,$30,89,Virginie Boone,"An intriguing combination of almost equal parts Malbec, Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot, Rock Wall's Romancer hails from Clarksburg's small Heringer Vineyard, and is bright, fruity and juicy with blackberry and strawberry flavors. Aromatic lavender and jasmine notes against a backdrop of meaty tobacco make the presence of Mourvedre apparent."
Viña Leyda 2002 Reserve Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),Viña Leyda,Red,Reserve,Carmenère,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",13.5%,$18,83,Michael Schachner,"Starts out with plum, cherry and red cabbage aromas, which lead to a palate of light red fruit and mild vegetal flavors. Broad and starchy on the finish, with some thickness. Has its moments but doesn't really strike up the band."
Spade Oak 2007 Heart of Gold Chardonnay (Gisborne),Spade Oak,White,Heart of Gold,Chardonnay,"Gisborne, New Zealand",13%,$20,86,Joe Czerwinski,"Rather pulpy in texture, but the flavors are fresh and fruity, with bold notes of pineapple, lime and fruit salad. Crisp and clean on the finish."
Turnbull 2010 Leopoldina Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Oakville),Turnbull,Red,Leopoldina Estate Grown,Cabernet Franc,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",14.9%,$75,86,,"There's a raisin skin bitterness and some raisiny, Port-like flavors to this Cabernet Franc, suggesting some of the grapes were roasted on the vine. Other than that, it's softly tannic and savory, with cherry pie and oak notes."
Argot 2014 Motifs Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),Argot,Red,Motifs,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Mountain, Sonoma, California, US",14.1%,$45,88,Virginie Boone,"Jammy, baked black cherry gives this wine a richness of flavor and texture, while cola and clove stand idly by in support.

Concha y Toro 2003 Marqués de Casa Concha Merlot (Peumo),Concha y Toro,Red,Marqués de Casa Concha,Merlot,"Peumo, Chile",14%,,89,Michael Schachner,"A wine the band Deep Purple could get into, because it's just that color and it rocks. The bouquet is dusty and loaded with dark chocolate and ripe blackberry. In the mouth, there's nothing miserly about it: lush plum, blackberry and licorice flavors are full and forward. Highly enjoyable, especially at this price."
Markko 2013 Select Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Ohio),Markko,Red,Select Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Ohio, Ohio, US",11.5%,$42,88,Fiona Adams,"Raspberry and pomegranate rise above aromas of white pepper and herbs. Tart cranberry, cedar and vanilla flavors are supported by chalky tannins and a vibrant vein of acidity, finishing on notes of cedar and raspberry."
Château de Ribebon 2015 Cabernet Franc  (Bordeaux Supérieur),Château de Ribebon,Red,Cabernet Franc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Bordeaux Supérieur, Bordeaux, France",13%,$40,90,Roger Voss,"Although the wine is labeled Cabernet Franc, it also has 15% Merlot in the blend. Nevertheless the ripe tannins and spicy perfumed character of the wine sing of rich Cabernet Franc. With its dense structure and tannins, the wine needs to age, so wait until 2021."
Cordella 2007  Brunello di Montalcino,Cordella,Red,,"Sangiovese Grosso, Sangiovese","Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$50,92,,"Opens with a sweet opulent nose driven by aromas of plump cherry, moist pipe tobacco, chocolate fudge, vanilla bean and ground espresso. But the wine is not modern or overtly international in terms of its style. It shows deep roots in Montalcino tradition and a bold, overt personality. Earth, leather and dried tobacco drive the finish."
Andretti 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Andretti,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",,$30,91,,"Here's a wine that needs time to show its stuff, but it's very good in its youth. Dark and thick, with strong dusty tannins, but a core of blackberry fruit. Cellar it until 2005 and try again."
Wellington 2012 Victory Reserve Meritage (Sonoma County),Wellington,Red,Victory Reserve,"Meritage, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",14.3%,$60,88,Virginie Boone,"This big-shouldered blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot offers soft waves of black fruit and smoky oak. It's accented with meatier elements of brick and tobacco."
Tapestry 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),Tapestry,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$22,91,Joe Czerwinski,"This great value turns the neat trick of boasting an almost molasses-like density of fruit without seeming overly heavy. It's full-bodied, with hints of smoke, vanilla and herbs that add complexity to the cherry fruit, while on the finish, the tannins are soft and the flavors linger elegantly. Drink now through 2012."
Acorn 2007 Allegria Vineyards Heritage Vines Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),Acorn,Red,Allegria Vineyards Heritage Vines,Zinfandel,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.8%,$35,87,,"This is a big, spicy, powerful Zinfandel that brims with berry, cherry, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors.

Falkner 2020 Viognier (Temecula Valley),Falkner,White,,Viognier,"Temecula Valley, South Coast, California, US",14%,$40,88,Matt Kettmann,"Snappy lime, lemon-flesh and citrus-blossom aromas indicate an acid-driven expression on the nose of this bottling. The palate begins with a fresh splash of that citrus, then widens toward riper honeydew and mango flavors."
Almquist 2013 Pinot Noir (Horse Heaven Hills),Almquist,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$35,84,Sean P. Sullivan,"Varietally designated Pinot Noirs are an extreme rarity from this warm region. This one brings notes of cranberry, copper penny and herb, although the aromas not in sync. The flavors are plump and sweet, showing a sense of elegance."
Les Vignerons de Cases de Péne 2003 Château de Peña Réserve C Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages),Les Vignerons de Cases de Péne,Red,Château de Peña Réserve C,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Côtes du Roussillon Villages, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",,$20,87,Roger Voss,"Based on old Carignan vines, this ripe, fruity wine is full of great barbecue-wine flavors. It's bold and juicy, with some dusty tannins and fresh red fruits on the finish."
Melville 2014 Estate Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),Melville,Red,Estate,,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",15%,$32,91,Matt Kettmann,"There's intriguing precision to the nose of this bottling from Chad Melville and family. A laser-sharp line of tart elderberry, black-plum skins and black-cherry skins cut through the dark earth, tar and purple-flower elements. The palate blends approachable black raspberry, dark strawberry and muddled mulberry fruit with touches of coffee and dark cocoa."
Patrice Moreux 2014 Corty Artisan Silex  (Pouilly-Fumé),Patrice Moreux,White,Corty Artisan Silex,Sauvignon Blanc,"Pouilly-Fumé, Loire Valley, France",13%,$25,89,Roger Voss,"The flint soil behind this wine gives it a stony, smoky character that is allied to the mineral texture. It's a ripe wine, still young with pure fruit and an intense acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2018."
Andes Grapes 2006 Ambar 1907 Malbec (Mendoza),Andes Grapes,Red,Ambar 1907,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.7%,$18,88,Michael Schachner,"Rubber and savory berry aromas lead it off. The palate shows good texture and overall smoothness, with round cassis and plum flavors. Very competent and solid on the finish, with toasty, warming afternotes and only a slight tannic grab. Textbook Malbec given the price range."
Walter Scott 2017 Cuvée Ruth Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),Walter Scott,Red,Cuvée Ruth,Pinot Noir,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.5%,$40,91,Paul Gregutt,"Strawberry and cherry fruit, wrapped in sweet spices, gives this a warm, open, drink-me character. A lovely streak of cherry tobacco informs the finish."
Domaine Jaume 2018 Référence Red (Vinsobres),Domaine Jaume,Red,Référence,Rhône-style Red Blend,"Vinsobres, Rhône Valley, France",14%,$30,92,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Silken in texture and redolent of kirsch, leather and dried earth, this full-bodied blend of Syrah (50%), Grenache (40%) and Mourvèdre (10%) is a powerful expression of ripeness calibrated by the zest of limestone soils and high-altitude vineyard sites. Fermented and matured in oak, it has black-cherry and cassis flavors accented by smoke, vanilla and clove along with a fine, feathery rim of tannins. Delicious already, the wine should improve through 2028."
Valdivieso 2018 Single Vineyard Piedra Hermosa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Cauquenes Valley),Valdivieso,Red,Single Vineyard Piedra Hermosa Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Cauquenes Valley, Chile",13%,$23,88,Michael Schachner,"Jumpy red fruit aromas suggest hot rocks and iron. A fresh, lean palate is agile, while raspberry, currant and herbal green flavors reflect the wine's cool coastal origins. Zesty acidity and red fruit leftovers drive a lean finish."
Miscreant Project 2017 Boldfaced Lie Miscreant Affirmation #03 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Miscreant Project,Red,Boldfaced Lie Miscreant Affirmation #03,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.7%,$16,87,Sean P. Sullivan,"Cabernet Sauvignon accounts for 60% of this wine, with the rest Merlot. The aromas are bright, with notes of rose hips, raspberry gummy, dried herb and spice. Fairly smoky cherry flavors follow, creating some distraction."
Clos du Bois 2001 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),Clos du Bois,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",13.8%,$17,84,,"A simple, soft, fruity and one-dimensional Pinot that offers up slight flavors of raspberries, pepper and tobacco.

McWilliam's 2017 McW Reserve 660 Pinot Noir (Tumbarumba),McWilliam's,Red,McW Reserve 660,Pinot Noir,"Tumbarumba, New South Wales, Australia",13.5%,$20,91,Christina Pickard,"The little-known wine region of Tumbarumba, on the foothills of the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales, often producers fascinating cool-climate high-altitude wines. This Pinot is no exception. The nose is a fragrant combo of fresh tarragon and other wild scrubby herbs, red berries, florals and white-peppery spice. Light to medium bodied, the palate is fresh and bright, with juicy fruit and savory spicy undertones. It's slippery in texture, with a soft grip of herb-flecked tannins. Drink slightly chilled with springtime cuisine."
Kendall-Jackson 1997 Elite Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Kendall-Jackson,Red,Elite,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.6%,$100,91,,"Very aromatic, showing a complex nose of cherry, spice, smoked and raw meat, and tobacco. The flavors are copious, too, with strong black cherry, licorice and tobacco elements. Balance and structure are beautiful here, and the coffee-chocolate finish has very good length, showing spice and blueberry accents. Lovely already, it will be better in four years and will drink well to 2010."
Bodegas Palacio 2014 Cosme Palacio Crianza  (Rioja),Bodegas Palacio,Red,Cosme Palacio Crianza,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",14%,$20,89,Michael Schachner,"Olive, raisin, cassis, clove and wood grain aromas constitute an interesting nose. A full palate with resiny oak and noticeable tannins sets up a flavor profile based mostly on clove, oak and berry fruit. While this remains oaky across the finish, there's enough dark fruit here to make this well worth a go. Drink through 2022."
Château Lilian Ladouys 2010 Barrel sample  (Saint-Estèphe),Château Lilian Ladouys,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Estèphe, Bordeaux, France",,,94,Roger Voss,"93-95 A fine wine, the juicy fruits overlaying the firm structure.

Smooth and full bodied, the rounded palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and pipe tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. It closes on a graphite note and the warmth of alcohol that throws it slightly off balance."
Stemmler 2013 Anderson Valley Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Stemmler,Red,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14.1%,$44,93,Jim Gordon,"Gorgeous fruit aromas and flavors fill out this plush-textured and softly balanced wine.

It's a Bordeaux blend, but the recipe changes every year. This is very nice and drinking well, smooth with a nicely resolved mix of black fruits, smoky wood, pepper and a bit of bacon fat."
Wohlmuth 2019 Ried Dr. Wunsch Riesling (Südsteiermark),Wohlmuth,White,Ried Dr. Wunsch,Riesling,"Südsteiermark, Austria",12.5%,,97,Anne Krebiehl MW,"The lemon note on the nose is tender yet focused and pure. The concentrated palate comes off as crystalline in nature, almost fragile. The mentholated freshness lingers on the palate. Drink by 2050."
La Honda Winery 2013 Lonehawk Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),La Honda Winery,Red,Lonehawk Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Santa Cruz Mountains, Central Coast, California, US",13.9%,$42,87,Matt Kettmann,"Rich blackberry and candied black-cherry aromas meet with strong cedar, roast beef, smoke, olive, soy and a tarry quality on the nose of this bottling. It's very dry and sticky with tannins on the sip, which relegate the flavors of red cherry and roasting herbs to the background. The 100% American oak treatment remains prominent, so this may evolve more favorably with time."

Suave and supple tannins pair with medium acidity and evident glycerol, making this an easy-drinking red.

The fruit is enormous, bursting with cherry and mocha flavors. It seems rather sweet now, but that may be its youth. Give it until mid-2006 to come together."
Raphael 2012 Chardeaux White (North Fork of Long Island),Raphael,White,Chardeaux,White Blend,"North Fork of Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",11.6%,$16,85,Anna Lee C.

Gan Eden 1994 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),Gan Eden,White,,Chardonnay,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",,$13,82,,"Apple-cider and earth aromas open to a simple apple-toast palate.

Domaine Jérome Marcadet 2020 Pinot Noir Gamay Pinot Noir-Gamay (Cheverny),Domaine Jérome Marcadet,Red,Pinot Noir Gamay,,"Cheverny, Loire Valley, France",14%,$17,89,Roger Voss,The dense texture of this wine promises well. It supports the black fruits and acidity in a combination that has weight and plenty of richness. The wine will be at its best from 2022.
Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 AVA Series Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),Willamette Valley Vineyards,Red,AVA Series,Pinot Noir,"Chehalem Mountains, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.4%,$50,92,Paul Gregutt,"The grapes for this limited-production wine come from the outstanding Alloro vineyard. The texture and complexity are immediately apparent. Mouthcoating plum and cherry fruit combines with lively citrus, toasty oak and a rich chocolate note. Drink now or put some away for a few years, but don't miss this one."
Schug 2018 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Coast),Schug,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$25,88,Virginie Boone,"From a trio of vineyards, this white is grassy and fruity in equal measure, with flavors of pineapple, maraschino cherry and kiwi. Lively acidity keeps it fresh in the glass, leading to a mineral-laden finish."
Ram's Gate 2018 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Ram's Gate,Red,Gap's Crown Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$75,91,Virginie Boone,"Demure in dense red fruit, this wine comes to life in lively acidity and a crispy texture that defines its cool-climate provenance. Black tea, nutmeg and a note of dried herb provide savory earthiness and length."
Delas Frères 2000 Les Challeys  (Saint-Joseph),Delas Frères,Red,Les Challeys,,"Saint-Joseph, Rhône Valley, France",,$20,89,Roger Voss,"A ripe, perfumed, relatively soft wine, which is going to give great pleasure with its juicy fruit, ripe jelly flavors and balancing acidity. You could enjoy this wine within a year, but it should age well over the next five or six."
Stewart 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Stewart,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$65,90,,"A little ungainly now, with stiff tannins and lots of fresh, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit colliding with unintegrated oak notes. All the parts are there, but they need until 2019–2020 to meld."
Château Clément-Pichon 2010 Barrel sample  (Haut-Médoc),Château Clément-Pichon,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Haut-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",,,91,Roger Voss,"90-92 Perfumed, juicy wine, fresh, with delicious acidity and blackberry fruits. A fruit bomb of a wine."
Peter Lehmann 1999 The Mentor Red (Barossa Valley),Peter Lehmann,Red,The Mentor,"Cabernet Blend, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",,$50,90,,"Though it's named after Peter Lehmann, this is not an imposing, masculine wine. It has plum and cassis fruit at its core and fresh cream on the nose, with a moderate, appropriate-for-food weight. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Shiraz and Malbec."
Willamette Valley Vineyards 2003 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Willamette Valley Vineyards,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",,$19,87,Paul Gregutt,"This is a good effort for the price, showing spicy cherry and raspberry fruit, light hints of herb, beet root and moist earth. It seems to get a bit earthier as it weaves into the finish, but it's well balanced and certainly well matched to salmon, swordfish or poultry dishes."
Boeckel 2010 Réserve Riesling (Alsace),Boeckel,White,Réserve,Riesling,"Alsace, Alsace, France",,,86,Roger Voss,"This is a steely wine wrapped with white and green fruit flavors. It is clean, bright and full of pear and crisp apple notes. The tangy after taste is floral. Ready to drink in six months."
Jefferson Vineyards 2014 Estate Reserve Petit Verdot (Monticello),Jefferson Vineyards,Red,Estate Reserve,Petit Verdot,"Monticello, Virginia, US",13.5%,$43,90,Carrie Dykes,"This Petit Verdot feels almost sinful, bursting with aromas of dark chocolate, followed by notes of violets, prune and coffee. Balanced by bright acidity and well integrated tannins, this feels velvety on the palate, with a smooth, plush finish."
Lambert 2017 Mustang Sally Shiraz (Barossa Valley),Lambert,Red,Mustang Sally,,"Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",13.5%,$17,88,Christina Pickard,"This Barossa Shiraz veers on the lighter brighter side of the road than most, although it's still a fairly full-figured wine. A medley of red berry fruit, mint, mocha and cloves make up the nose, while the palate is satiny in texture and wound by soft but structured tannins amidst prickly savory brambly tones. There's an appealing fruity and spice finish."
Château Biston-Brillette 2015  Moulis-en-Médoc,Château Biston-Brillette,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Moulis-en-Médoc, Bordeaux, France",13%,$20,92,Roger Voss,"Ripe, and densely textured, this wine shows an impressive, rich balance between fruit and tannins, with a dry core and broad black fruits that have great intensity. This wine, with 12 months in wood, conveys spice, concentration and excellent potential. Drink from 2024."
Umani Ronchi 2003 Casal di Serra Vecchie Vigne  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore),Umani Ronchi,White,Casal di Serra Vecchie Vigne,"Verdicchio, Italian White","Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore, Central Italy, Italy",14.5%,$22,87,,"Aromas of honey, spring flowers, grapefruit and almond skin are intact and beautifully presented thanks to stainless steel fermentation. This is a late harvest wine from 30-year-old vines that earns points for its natural ability to pair with food."
Château la Fleur-Pétrus 2008  Pomerol,Château la Fleur-Pétrus,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pomerol, Bordeaux, France",,,93,Roger Voss,"A powerful, chocolate- and berry fruit-flavored wine, powered by ripe tannins and juicy acidity. It has a solid foundation of tannins, on which is built a rich edifice of fruit."
Chateau Capion 2009 Le Colombier White (Coteaux du Languedoc),Chateau Capion,White,Le Colombier,Rhône-style White Blend,"Coteaux du Languedoc, Languedoc-Roussillon, France",13.5%,$29,85,Lauren Buzzeo,"This is a rich and round white that needs a bit more cut to its overall character. Honeyed peach, buttered toast and heavy cream all abound, screaming for more acidity to liven up the party."
Glenora 2001 Vintner's Select Riesling (Finger Lakes),Glenora,White,Vintner's Select,Riesling,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",12%,$15,83,Joe Czerwinski,
Château Figeac 2008 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),Château Figeac,Red,Barrel sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,93,Roger Voss,"92-94 Barrel sample. Very sweet new wood, caramel aromas that give the wine an initial softness. Then acidity and sweet blackberry flavors move in, suggesting that this will be a finely balanced wine once it is bottled."
Grant Burge 2003 Balthasar Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa),Grant Burge,Red,Balthasar,,"Barossa, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$33,88,,"With just 4% Viognier, for better or worse it doesn't have that  lifted-aroma quality that Viognier usually lends these kinds of blends. Feel is rough at first but smoothes out; there's a fair dose of wood here. With air, blueberry flavors come to the fore. Still this is not a deep wine. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd."
Haan 2004 Prestige Merlot (Barossa Valley),Haan,Red,Prestige,Merlot,"Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$48,88,Joe Czerwinski,"Merlot in the Barossa can be a tricky proposition, but this bottling successfully juxtaposes superripe, chocolate fudge notes with surprisingly tart acids. Hints of licorice, vanilla and black cherries impart complexity, while creamy tannins and crisp acids mark the finish. Drink now–2012."
Be Good or Be Gone 2015 BG 2 The French Revolution Lot 3 Red (Vin de France),Be Good or Be Gone,Red,BG 2 The French Revolution Lot 3,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Vin de France, France Other, France",13.5%,$14,85,Lauren Buzzeo,"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon from Cévennes, 30% Grenache and 20% Syrah from Southern Rhône, this opens with a gamy, rustic bouquet of iron, leather, black plum and boysenberry. It's gripping and tight on the palate, with a lingering cured-meat character through the close."
Darcie Kent Vineyards 2009 Crown Block Merlot (Livermore Valley),Darcie Kent Vineyards,Red,Crown Block,Merlot,"Livermore Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$35,87,Virginie Boone,"A dark, plummy Livermore Valley Merlot that reminds one of herb-encrusted roasted meats, and would be a good wine to pair with such a feast. Full-bodied and lush, with a smoky, oaky finish and cedar lurking throughout."
Castello di Monsanto 1999 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),Castello di Monsanto,Red,Riserva,Sangiovese,"Chianti Classico, Tuscany, Italy",,$23,90,Michael Schachner,"Intense in the nose, with sharp leathery notes. Pure and clear cherry fruit forms the basis of what is a splendidly clean palate. The finish is tannic and tight, but it provides excellent support for the wine and indicates that it will age well. This is a leaner, traditional wine. Fanatics of fat, rich fruit bombs may not be impressed. —M.S."
Aljibes 2011 Petit Verdot (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),Aljibes,Red,,Petit Verdot,"Vino de la Tierra de Castilla, Central Spain, Spain",13%,$30,87,Michael Schachner,"Grapy, horsey berry aromas are herbal, jumbled and suggestive of untamed brush. A full but flabby palate offers funky, lightly herbal flavors of cherry and berry. A sticky, sweet-tasting, finish lacks cut but is far from out of whack."
Patricia Green Cellars 2017 Notorious Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Patricia Green Cellars,Red,Notorious,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.8%,$85,97,Paul Gregutt,"This is the only wine among the winery's vast portfolio that is aged in 100% new French oak. Its green label also sets it apart from the rest, and it's priced as a reserve (from a winery whose every bottle could be called a reserve without a quibble). It's a stunning wine, vibrant with rich red and black berry fruit, cherry, orange peel, root beer, toast, chocolate and on it goes. Just a splendid bottle in every possible way."
Abad Dom Bueno 2015 Godello (Bierzo),Abad Dom Bueno,White,,"Godello, Spanish White","Bierzo, Northern Spain, Spain",13%,$24,87,Michael Schachner,"Aromas of white peach and dusty minerals lead to a chunky palate that struggles to maintain its shape and cut. Pithy, lightly bitter peach and citrus flavors end with the sensation of licking a peach pit."
Wakefield 2015 Jaraman Coonawarra &amp; Clare Valley Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),Wakefield,Red,Jaraman Coonawarra & Clare Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,"South Australia, South Australia, Australia",14.5%,$30,90,Christina Pickard,"This vintage is a strong offering. The fruit is from two top South Aussie Cabernet regions: Clare Valley and Coonawarra, and both regions shine through. The nose leads with plums, currants, pencil lead, black olives and oak spice. The palate follows, with lifted tangy and juicy fruit that acts as a counterweight to the fine chalky tannins and oak spice. This is a relatively straightforward but varietally expressive drop with a long, brambly finish."
José Maria da Fonseca 2019 Periquita Rosé (Península de Setúbal),José Maria da Fonseca,Rose,Periquita,Rosé,"Península de Setúbal, Portugal",13%,$10,85,Roger Voss,"The wine is all fruit, dominated by Castelão at its ripest and crispest. It is lightly textured, with red currant fruits and perfumed acidity. Drink now."
Bloomer Creek 2013 Tanzen Dame Auten Vineyard 2nd Clone 10 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),Bloomer Creek,White,Tanzen Dame Auten Vineyard 2nd Clone 10 Dry,Riesling,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",11.3%,$40,87,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Waxy lanolin, lime zest and savory nuts waft solemnly from this distinctly earthy dry Riesling. It's a showcase of minerality—shades of clay, dust, smoke and rock—but fascinatingly so, bolstered by a shock of lemon-lime acidity."
Sparkling Pointe 2006 Brut Séduction  (North Fork of Long Island),Sparkling Pointe,Sparkling,Brut Séduction,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","North Fork of Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",12.5%,$72,90,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Complexities of mushroom, caramel and brioche lend a haze of maturity over delicate strawberry and cherry notes in this Champagne-style sparkling,which was aged for eight years over lees. Tiny, persistent bubbles spread seamlessly on the palate, accentuated by streaks of racy acidity."
Left Bend 2013 Muns Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),Left Bend,Red,Muns Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Santa Cruz Mountains, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$40,91,Matt Kettmann,"Featuring a unique and intriguingly fresh and floral nose, this shows bright strawberry, fresh-pressed hibiscus flowers, exotic vanilla-cinnamon notes and hints of slate and chaparral. The palate is just a hair less exciting, with raspberry, cranberry, white pepper, white sage and dried mint, all wrapped with tart acidity and tannins."
Columbia Crest 2016 Reserve Late Harvest Muscat Canelli (Columbia Valley (WA)),Columbia Crest,Dessert,Reserve Late Harvest,"Muscat Canelli, Muscat","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",10.5%,$30,88,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas leap out of the glass, with notes of freshly peeled tangerine, white flowers, jasmine and honeysuckle. It drinks quite sweet but manages to stay in balance. It's a delicious example of this variety. Enjoy it for dessert."
Denbies Wine Estate NV Greenfields  (England),Denbies Wine Estate,Sparkling,Greenfields,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling",,12.5%,$29,91,Anne Krebiehl MW,"Restrained creaminess on the nose promises subtle refreshment. The palate follows with a harmonious rounded notion of red apple, ripe lemon and citrus-spiked shortbread that unites seamlessly. The fizz is fine and creamy giving sustained freshness, real pleasure and utter honesty. It's very charming and very lovely."
Siduri 2016 Ewald Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Siduri,Red,Ewald Vineyard,Pinot Noir,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.3%,$55,92,Virginie Boone,"Tart in complex acidity and subtle flavors of strawberry, pomegranate and orange, this is a light-bodied, lightly ripe wine, that's angular and elegant."
Nickel & Nickel 1999 Stelling Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),Nickel & Nickel,Red,Stelling Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Oakville, Napa, California, US",13.7%,$125,91,Joe Czerwinski,
Raphael 2014 First Label Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),Raphael,White,First Label,Chardonnay,"North Fork of Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",13.3%,$29,87,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Notes of pressed apple and pear mingle into complexities of vanilla, clove and toast in this barrel-aged Chardonnay. Full bodied in style, it's a ripe richly textured wine but balanced briskly. The finish lingers long."
Janzen 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Janzen,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$50,85,,"Soft, overripe and simple, with chocolate-covered raisin, cassis and caramelized oak flavors. It's delicious, in the modern style of ripe extraction, but lacks structure and dryness."
Lieubeau 2016 Domaine de la Fruitière Gneiss de Bel Abord Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),Lieubeau,White,Domaine de la Fruitière Gneiss de Bel Abord Sur Lie,"Melon, Other White","Muscadet Sèvre et Maine, Loire Valley, France",12%,$18,90,Roger Voss,"From gneiss base rock that is similar to granite, this tight, taut and mineral wine is intensely crisp, dominated by acidity and by bright citrus flavors. It comes from a vineyard that is being converted to organic farming. The wine is young and will be ready to drink from 2018."
Eberle 2013 Mill Road Vineyard Viognier (Paso Robles),Eberle,White,Mill Road Vineyard,Viognier,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",15%,$23,89,Matt Kettmann,"The grape's usual peachy aromas show on this wine from regional pioneer Gary Eberle, along with lemon juice, honey and a touch of minerality. There is a nice mineral-driven tension on the palate, with flavors of apple and pear cider. It's a solid, down-the-middle take on the grape—not too ripe, not too thin."
Infidel 2014 Zinfandel (Lodi),Infidel,Red,,Zinfandel,"Lodi, Central Valley, California, US",14.7%,$25,87,Jim Gordon,"The freshness and concentration of the fruit flavors in this full-bodied wine is exceptional. It smells like Concord juice and tastes dark and grapy, forming a simple but appealing personality that's hard to resist."
Fondazione Edmund Mach 2010 Istituto Agrario San Michele all'Adige Sauvignon (Trentino),Fondazione Edmund Mach,White,Istituto Agrario San Michele all'Adige,"Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc","Trentino, Northeastern Italy, Italy",12.5%,,87,,"From the vineyards of Italy's most important school of enology, this bright Sauvignon delivers clean aromas of passion fruit, citrus, peach and tomato leaf. It's fresh, with balanced acidity."
Anglim 2017 Pinot Noir (Adelaida District),Anglim,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Adelaida District, Central Coast, California, US",13.8%,$34,88,Matt Kettmann,"Ripe aromas of red cherry and baking spice show on the nose of this bottling of Pinot Noir from a relatively warm area. The flavors are quite extracted on the palate, with blackberry, boysenberry and dried mint."
El Rosal 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon,El Rosal,Red,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Mendoza Province, Argentina",13.4%,$17,87,Michael Schachner,"From San Rafael in southern Mendoza, this Cab Sauvignon picks up a little more steam and complexity every time you go back to it. The nose is your basic cassis and raspberry, while the medium-weight palate features ripe fruit finishing in a sweet cascade of milk chocolate and burnt brown sugar. Satisfying, especially if you like a hint of sweetness to your Cab."
Davis Family 2016 Rosé de Noir Dutton Ranch Sparkling (Russian River Valley),Davis Family,Sparkling,Rosé de Noir Dutton Ranch,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",12.5%,$55,90,Virginie Boone,"Made by the Méthode Champenoise from Pinot Noir grapes grown at the Green Valley ranch, this tastes of watermelon, grapefruit and cherry. Meaty in texture with moderate weight, it is lively and fresh, with lasting acidity."
Tarara 2010 Whitie's D9 A Big Bold Red (Virginia),Tarara,Fortified,Whitie's D9 A Big Bold,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Virginia, Virginia, US",18%,$50,83,,"As the name suggests, this blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon does taste big and bold, but it also tastes hot and lopsided. It has a Port-like consistency, with notes of charred sesame seed, chocolate and dark cherry that lack precision."
Maryhill 2010 Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),Maryhill,Red,Proprietor's Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.5%,$30,85,Paul Gregutt,"This simple Cabernet Sauvignon is lightly fruity and forward, with berry flavors that seem to fade on the midpalate. It resolves in a wash of drying, herbal tannins."
One Hope 2009 Two Pisces Vineyard Reserve Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Sonoma Coast),One Hope,Sparkling,Two Pisces Vineyard Reserve Blanc de Noir,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, California, US",12.4%,$45,91,,"It's easy to like this smooth, clean sparkling wine, which hails from the Petaluma Gap, an increasingly important area in the cool, foggy south of the Russian River Valley. It's very rich in raspberries and strawberries, with notes of sweet vanilla and yeast. The mouthfeel is smooth and elegant."
Babcock 1998 Pinot Gris (Santa Barbara County),Babcock,White,,,"Santa Barbara County, Central Coast, California, US",,$14,88,,"More like an Italian Pinot Grigio than an Alsatian Pinot Gris, this wine is light and lively on the palate, with a peachy-floral nose, a slightly creamy mouthfeel, and zesty lemon-lime flavors. Finishes with a touch of bitter almond."
J. Bookwalter 2015 Protagonist Conner-Lee Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),J. Bookwalter,Red,Protagonist Conner-Lee Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.8%,$60,91,Sean P. Sullivan,"This brings roasted coffee bean, char, leafy green herb, spice and cherry aromas, and the oak (75% new French) plays a prominent part in the show. The palate is rich, textured and supple, with plentiful black cherry and barrel flavors that linger on the finish. It hits the gong hard, feeling totally hedonistic."
Gorman 2014 The Bully Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),Gorman,Red,The Bully,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Red Mountain, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",14.8%,$50,91,Sean P. Sullivan,"The aromas are wound up at present, with notes of generous barrel spices, dried herb, dark fruit and pencil lead. The dark-cherry flavors are smooth and supple, backed by fine-grained tannins."
Wattle Creek 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Yorkville Highlands),Wattle Creek,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Yorkville Highlands, North Coast, California, US",13.8%,$15,86,Virginie Boone,"With layers of nutty, toasty oak flavors lingering in the background, this is a Sauvignon Blanc with lushness to its core of melon, guava and grass notes."
Steiner Family Vineyards 2012 Cabernet Franc (El Dorado),Steiner Family Vineyards,Red,,Cabernet Franc,"El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",13.9%,$25,88,Jim Gordon,"A smoky, peppery aroma and equally spicy flavor set this medium-bodied wine apart from the pack. Dry in style, it has a firm, tannic texture. Bring out the lamb or beef to enjoy with this one."
Acumen 2019 Mountainside Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),Acumen,White,Mountainside,Sauvignon Blanc,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14%,$30,88,Virginie Boone,Stony mineral gives way to a tangy tropical midpalate of sweet peach and melon in this creamy full-figured wine.

Ponzi 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Ponzi,Red,Reserve,Pinot Noir,"Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",13.6%,$60,94,Paul Gregutt,"This bottling spent 20 months in French oak (30% new), and incorporates fruit from Ponzi's Aurora, Abetina and Madrona vineyards. Superripe aromas and flavors conjure up a rich and riveting mix of black cherry with amaro-like botanical nuances. This profound wine is already irresistible, but stash a few bottles in your cellar, to drink now through 2030."
Wittmann 2018 Rotwein Trocken Spätburgunder (Rheinhessen),Wittmann,Red,Rotwein Trocken,"Spätburgunder, Pinot Noir","Rheinhessen, Germany",12.5%,$30,93,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"The nose is quiet here suggesting trace hints of toast and smoky mineral, but the palate of this spry, fresh-footed Pinot Noir offers bold strokes of zippy black cherry and raspberry. Freshly concentrated and edged by fine-grained, silky tannins, it's a wine that's ready now but should drink beautifully through at least 2028."
Navarro 2013 Chardonnay (Mendocino),Navarro,White,,Chardonnay,"Mendocino, Mendocino County, California, US",13.6%,$19,89,Jim Gordon,"It's easy to appreciate the buttery aromas, vivid and tangy fruit like crisp apples and Bosc pears, and lively texture with appetizing acidity, elegance and raciness. It's not a big wine but a finely detailed one."
Rosemount 2006 Pinot Grigio (South Eastern Australia),Rosemount,White,,Pinot Grigio,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",,$12,86,,"A wine that's been under development at Rosemount for three years, this is the variety's debut under the Rosemount label. It's plump and round in the mouth, featuring honey and peach notes that turn crisper on the finish."
Closerie du Bailli 2012  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,Closerie du Bailli,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",,$21,87,Roger Voss,"Powerfully structured, this is a dense wine, with layers of ripe fruit as well as tannins. It is concentrated, firm and showing its structure. The black plum fruit flavors from the 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon blend give weight and a broad character to the aftertaste. Drink from 2017. Produced by Alliance Bourg."
Joseph Swan Vineyards 2004 Trenton Estate Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),Joseph Swan Vineyards,Red,Trenton Estate Vineyard,,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.2%,$27,86,,"Tons of jammy fruit in this softly tannic, easy-to-drink wine.

Sartori 2004 I Saltari Le Vigne di Turano  (Valpolicella Superiore),Sartori,Red,I Saltari Le Vigne di Turano,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara, Italian Red","Valpolicella Superiore, Veneto, Italy",13%,$27,87,,"Compared to the 2003 vintage, the fruit is slightly more vibrant and polished here. There's also a slightly green note of herb or dill that we didn't notice in the past. The mouthfeel is, however, bright, crisp and refreshingly informal."
Veramonte 2004 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),Veramonte,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Casablanca Valley, Chile",13.5%,$10,88,,"Highly aromatic, this explodes with bright passion fruit scents and herbal pungency. Lots of pink grapefruit flavor and a zesty, crisp finish make this eminently drinkable. Drink now, as an apéritif or with light appetizers."
Firestone 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Firestone,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.3%,$22,90,Matt Kettmann,"Aromas of dark berry, mint and fudge kick off the nose of this bottling.

Poggio Antico 2007 Madre Red (Toscana),Poggio Antico,Red,Madre,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13.5%,,95,,"A 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet, this wine is rich and opulent, without being at all heavy or exaggerated. The mouthfeel is smooth, soft but structured and there is a long fruit and spice flavored finish."
Villa Bibbiani 2018 Pulignano Sangiovese (Toscana),Villa Bibbiani,Red,Pulignano,Sangiovese,"Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",14%,$17,89,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of red-skinned berry, leather and underbrush lead the nose on this Sangiovese. The straightforward, juicy palate offers raspberry, cinnamon and white pepper alongside smooth tannins. Drink soon."
WildHaven 2011 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),WildHaven,Red,,Merlot,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",13.5%,$9,84,Sean P. Sullivan,"Though 100% Merlot, it seems more reminiscent of a Syrah with notes of blue fruit and ash. The flavors are light with chalky, mouthcoating tannins."
Leacock's NV Rainwater Tinta Negra Mole (Madeira),Leacock's,Port/Sherry,Rainwater,"Tinta Negra Mole, Portuguese Red","Madeira, Portugal",18%,$13,86,Joe Czerwinski,"On the lighter, fresher side of Madeira, with candied citrus flavors edging out honey and nut notes. Ends with a smoky, citrusy tang."
Capitoso 2003  Rioja,Capitoso,Red,,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$14,85,Michael Schachner,"Rather stocky, with beef bouillon, blackberry and rubber on the nose. The feel is solid while the plum, berry and leathery flavors display some of the heat of the year. Not a refined wine but good in an easy, drink-me-now way. Could use cheese or some roasted meat."
Lambert Bridge 1998 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),Lambert Bridge,White,,Chardonnay,"Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US",13.5%,$18,89,,"Very nicely composed with toasty oak over apple/pear fruit and crème brûlée aromas.

NV Imperial Amontillado VOS Sherry (Jerez),Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.,Port/Sherry,Imperial Amontillado VOS,Sherry,"Jerez, Andalucia, Spain",19.5%,$100,92,Michael Schachner,"A turbid brownish-gold color is cloudy but nothing else about this amontillado is unclear. Concentrated aromas of nut oil, pecan pie, molasses and sweat are rugged and raw. Blasting acidity creates pinch on the palate, while this tastes salty and like almonds, pecan pie and white pepper.

This mature beauty still has plenty of life left in it, as vibrant notes of orange peel, apple skin and wood-grilled peach are met with complementary tones of honeycomb, candied ginger and toasted challah. The palate is full and creamy, but very bright, with mouthwatering acidity that cuts through the rich baked apple, pear butter and toasted sweet spice flavors. Drink now–2020."

The sip is extremely well textured, with acidity that rips through the rounded cherimoya-flesh and citrus-peel flavors into the finish."
Groth 2014 Hillview Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Groth,White,Hillview Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",14.5%,$30,91,Virginie Boone,"This is a thick, rich and layered white from Oak Knoll District-grown estate fruit. It's inviting, with lemon chiffon, baked pineapple and anise. Medium bodied and not afraid to be robust, wet-stone minerality brings it together."

Lynmar 2014 Old Vines Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),Lynmar,White,Old Vines,Chardonnay,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.3%,$70,95,Virginie Boone,"This is a decidedly beautiful wine, a carefully crafted offering of Tahitian vanilla bean, caramelized apple and juicy peach that is integrated and buoyant in acidity.

Simone 2008 Winemaker's Collection Syrah (Colchagua Valley),Simone,Red,Winemaker's Collection,,"Colchagua Valley, Chile",13.5%,$15,85,Michael Schachner,"Starts out kind of murky and pasty, with gummy black fruit and compost aromas. Airing helps it escape that shell, and in the mouth there's rubbery blueberry flavors mixed with mildly tart rhubarb and bramble. Good enough, but doesn't do much to push the envelope that is Chilean Syrah."

The palate combines an array of red fruit with hints of herb and mint, proving quite bold."
WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Gisèle Pinot Noir (Yamhill-Carlton),WillaKenzie Estate,Red,Gisèle,Pinot Noir,"Yamhill-Carlton, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US",14.2%,VivinoWine.com,90,Paul Gregutt,"This entry level cuvée is finished with a screw cap, and pulled from a mix of barrels and clones from across the estate. It's forward, fruity and big, like an especially bold Beaujolais. Along with primary berry fruit there are light touches of pine needle and chocolate. It's full bodied and ready to go with your winter meal's roasted fowl."
Cellars 33 2016 Rosé (California),Cellars 33,Rose,,Rosé,"California, California Other, California, US",12.9%,$20,85,Jim Gordon,"This wine's light, sugary, red cherry and watermelon aromas lead to similar flavors and a light, lean texture. It has a bright coral color that's eye-catching."

Apple blossoms and limes on the nose are complemented by hints of diesel and a tart, steely finish."
Maurodos 2006 San Román  (Toro),Maurodos,Red,San Román,"Tinta de Toro, Tempranillo","Toro, Northern Spain, Spain",14.5%,$70,94,Michael Schachner,"Dark, tight and masculine smelling, San Román is once again one of the two or three best wines from Toro. This vintage is black, extracted and super ripe, but it maintains a fine level of balance and more than adequate freshness. Flavors of coconut, vanilla and chocolate announce generous new oak, as does mocha and espresso on the finish. Heady but ready; ageable for another 5–8 years."
La Selva 2015 Colli dell'Uccellina Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),La Selva,Red,Colli dell'Uccellina Riserva,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Morellino di Scansano, Tuscany, Italy",14.5%,$26,90,Kerin O’Keefe,"A blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot, this has aromas of baked plum, leather and a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus. Soft, juicy and full bodied, the palate offers black cherry, prune and licorice alongside velvety tannins. It's already hit its ideal drinking window so enjoy sooner rather than later."

It has big tannins, bold ripe fruit and a dark core of dryness. As with so many wines in this vintage, the fruitiness makes it work so well, ripe and bold black fruits that are finished off with acidity. Drink from 2018."

Sullivan,"Coming from fruit from Yakima Valley and Red Mountain, Grenache and Syrah (37%) play equal parts, with the rest Mourvèdre (26%).

The palate shows a lovely sense of deftness, balance and detail to the fruit and herb flavors that keep the interest up."
Taittinger NV La Française Brut  (Champagne),Taittinger,Sparkling,La Française Brut,"Champagne Blend, Sparkling","Champagne, Champagne, France",12%,$45,90,Roger Voss,"Tasted from a half bottle, the rich and complex flavors of Brut La Française show just that extra touch of maturity. The wine has peach and almond flavors that contrast well with the taut, nervy edge. It's full in the mouth and ripe, and works well both as an apéritif and a food Champagne."
Willm 2015 Gentil Réserve White (Alsace),Willm,White,Gentil Réserve,"Alsace white blend, White Blend","Alsace, Alsace, France",12.5%,$12,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,A lovely and light aroma of faint honeysuckle rises enticingly from the glass. The spiciness and florality of that same blossom also appear on the palate where they are joined by pear and wet earth notes. This is light and just a little fruity but with ample freshness—an easy but subtle and refreshing classic Alsace blend.
Leonard Kreusch 2013 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Riesling (Mosel),Leonard Kreusch,White,Piesporter Goldtröpfchen,Riesling,"Mosel, Germany",9%,$16,89,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"Savory whiffs of clay and smoked nuts belie the pristine white peach and grapefruit flavors that flood the palate of this semidry Riesling. It's juicy and primary, but irresistibly so, finishing on a lingering note of spice and saffron."

Sullivan,"Cabernet Sauvignon (45%) takes the lead on this blend, followed by Merlot (30%), Cabernet Franc (20%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas are all high toned, with notes of vanilla, herb and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are tightly wound, needing time in the cellar to stretch their legs. Best after 2020."
Telmo Rodríguez 2003 MR Mountain Wine Moscatel (Málaga),Telmo Rodríguez,Dessert,MR Mountain Wine,"Moscatel, Muscat","Málaga, Andalucia, Spain",13%,$19,90,Michael Schachner,"Even if this Moscatel begins with waxy aromas and whiffs of hard cheese, it is one excellent elixir. The palate will please with its honey, sweet melon and guava flavors, while the additional notes of white pepper and green melon add foundation. Excellent for the price, and it won't require a Master's degree in wine to enjoy. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain."
Jean-Claude Boisset 2003  Gevrey-Chambertin,Jean-Claude Boisset,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Gevrey-Chambertin, Burgundy, France",,$50,89,,"There's a traditional, Gevrey-meat note to the nose of this dark-fruited wine. It's creamy and mouthfilling, with black cherry flavors that pick up hints of anise on the finish. A blend of villages fruit with bits from two premier crus."
San Pedro 2014 1865 Single Vineyard Carmenère (Maule Valley),San Pedro,Red,1865 Single Vineyard,Carmenère,"Maule Valley, Chile",14.5%,$20,88,Michael Schachner,"Woody berry aromas come with more than enough olive, green spice and eucalyptus notes. On the palate, this is good but lacks tension and specificity. Flavors of creamy oak, blueberry and boysenberry are herbal and finish without much definition."
Page Mill Winery 2018 Chandler Vineyard Chardonnay (Livermore Valley),Page Mill Winery,White,Chandler Vineyard,Chardonnay,"Livermore Valley, Central Coast, California, US",13.5%,$28,89,Jim Gordon,"Bold butter and toasted-oak flavors give this full-bodied wine an assertive personality, while a rich, smooth texture pulls the big flavors together nicely."

Municipal Winemakers 2016 Mubbly Sparkling (California),Municipal Winemakers,Sparkling,Mubbly,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","California, California Other, California, US",11%,$30,90,Matt Kettmann,"By sourcing French Colombard and force carbonating like beer, David Potter made this fun and tasty wine as an antidote to the high prices that sparkling wine traditionally require. Aromas of apple cider, crisp Granny Smith apples, key lime, yellow melon and chalk lead into a palate laced with fatter bubbles and flavors of more apple and pear."
Apaltagua 2010 Signature Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Apaltagua,Red,Signature,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Maipo Valley, Chile",14%,$40,87,Michael Schachner,"This wine's crusty, minerally aromas of black fruit are lightly toasted and earthy. On the palate, it feels tannic and high in acidity, with roasted, earthy flavors of plum and raspberry. Concentrated and grabby on the finish, it has a touch of lemony oak and astringency."
Konrad 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Konrad,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Marlborough, New Zealand",12%,$20,90,Christina Pickard,"This wine, sourced from organically grown grapes and made by German ex-pats, shows plenty of waxy lemon, pineapple rind and green bean characters, with white pepper and mint aromas adding complexity. The palate is downright opulent—textural weight is balanced by tingly acidity with a salty finish."
Navarro 2013 Estate Bottled Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),Navarro,White,Estate Bottled,Gewürztraminer,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",13.7%,$20,87,Jim Gordon,"This emphasizes freshness and a light touch, rather than the assertive flavors that this varietal can produce. It smells like rose petals, has a soft texture, rose petal and pear flavors, and delivers a light spritzy feeling on the tongue."
Caligiore 2008 Grazioso Torrontés (Mendoza),Caligiore,White,Grazioso,Torrontés,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",12%,$10,84,Michael Schachner,"Peachy aromas are friendly, while the palate has a good feel to it along with green flavors of melon, lime and fresh veggies.

Lucy 2006 Rosé of Pinot Noir Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Lucy,Rose,Rosé of Pinot Noir,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.1%,$18,91,,"I love this wine. It's more like a Provençal rosé than almost anything out there, even though it's made from Pinot Noir. Dry, crisp and silky, it has interesting waves of cherryskin, rosehip tea, tobacco, vanilla and peppery spice flavors, and finishes impressively long."
Vall Llach 2013 Embruix Red (Priorat),Vall Llach,Red,Embruix,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Priorat, Catalonia, Spain",15.5%,$27,90,Michael Schachner,"Pure, deep berry aromas are accented by quality oak and a hint of earthy prune. Chewy, dense and concentrated on the palate, this tastes ripe, chocolaty and earthy, with blackberry and pepper flavors that stay the course and finish peppery and dark, with a mild note of rubber. Drink through 2019."
Château Ferrande 2010 Barrel sample  (Graves),Château Ferrande,White,Barrel sample,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Graves, Bordeaux, France",,,88,Roger Voss,"87-89 Soft wine, its acidity light. Pineapple and green apple flavors, with hints of wood."

It's an easy wine that should be a good apéritif."
Duquesa de la Victoria 2017  Rioja,Duquesa de la Victoria,Red,,Tempranillo,"Rioja, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$11,87,Michael Schachner,"Plum, cherry and berry aromas are standard but clean and fresh.

Has reserved aromas of black cherry and plum, and a solid core of black-cherry and berry fruit and spice. Dry and well balanced, not fat. Has a lot of white-tablecloth elegance. Intense, with powerful acids, but maybe just a little muddled on the midpalate."
Camins 2 Dreams 2018 Spear Vineyards Grüner Veltliner (Sta. Rita Hills),Camins 2 Dreams,White,Spear Vineyards,Grüner Veltliner,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",12.5%,$30,92,Matt Kettmann,"Tightly woven aromas of lime skin, chalk and honeydew rind show on the nose of this rare Grüner Veltliner from Santa Barbara County, made by married couple Tara Gomez and Mireia Taribó.

The nose shows blackberry puree, fresh lilacs, lava rocks and background pepper and vanilla. The palate is rich with espresso bean, violets, lavender and dried blueberries, lifted by minty herbs and peppery spice."

Right now, it's a little tough in acids and tannins, although the blackberry, cherry, black currant and smoky oak flavors are rich and fine and enjoyable now. But it should soften and be even more approachable after 2013."
Saarloos & Sons 2008 194Five The Union Red (Santa Ynez Valley),Saarloos & Sons,Red,194Five The Union,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Santa Ynez Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.5%,$38,85,,"Simple and jammy, with black cherry, black raspberry and chocolate chip cupcake flavors.

This makes two out of two stand-out wines Wine Enthusiast has reviewed from newcomer Kehret, where Steve Leveque is master winemaker. Best from 2024."
Icaria 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Icaria,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13.8%,$30,88,,"Sweet new oak brings a jacket of buttered cinnamon toast to this soft, ripe Cabernet.

Count Károlyi 2012 Grüner Veltliner (Hungary),Count Károlyi,White,,Grüner Veltliner,"Hungary, Hungary",12%,$11,87,Anna Lee C. Iijima,"While ebulliently floral and fruity with notes of orange blossom and white peach, a bracing hit of lemon balm and lime zest make this bright, brisk Grüner Veltliner especially refreshing. It lingers long on the palate with a bristling minerality."
Sola 2014 Syrah (Mendocino County),Sola,Red,,,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",14.2%,$15,91,Jim Gordon,"Ripe and bold in flavor, this polished, focused wine is full bodied and firmly tannic. It has effusive blackberry aromas and wonderfully dry, concentrated flavors."

Seven Peaks 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),Seven Peaks,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",,$15,87,,"This is quite a good Cab for the ripe currant and black cherry flavors, firm tannins and smooth mouthfeel. It has that fancy complexity you want from a good red wine, and is priced fairly for the quality."

Sullivan,"This wine was whole-cluster pressed and puncheon fermented, with native malolactic fermentation. It's intriguing, with aromas of corn on the cob, lees, almond butter and chamomile that are followed by a dense flavorful palate. The balance is exquisite."
Rento 2003  Ribera del Duero,Rento,Red,,"Tinto del Pais, Tempranillo","Ribera del Duero, Northern Spain, Spain",13.5%,$60,82,Michael Schachner,"There's a lot of raw power on this jumbled red that starts with rubber and spice before settling on maple. The mouth is a cacaphony of loud flavors, while the finish is stark. Needs finesse to match the aggressiveness."
Radio Boca 2008 Tempranillo (Valencia),Radio Boca,Red,,Tempranillo,"Valencia, Levante, Spain",13%,$8,82,Michael Schachner,"Starts out “smoky” but quickly degenerates toward murky and stemmy smelling. The palate has a bland feel along with roasted, leafy, dried-out flavors of raspberry and earthy plum. Not a prime-time wine."
Stinson 2014 Chardonnay (Monticello),Stinson,White,,Chardonnay,"Monticello, Virginia, US",13.5%,$24,87,Carrie Dykes,"Bright in aromas of pineapple, lemon and green apple, but also boasting sweet cream and yeastiness, this wine is layered on the nose.

This feels full and weighty, with nectarine and orange flavors. On the finish, dry citrus flavors are round and lasting but low on elegance. Drink now."
Lava Cap 2017 Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (El Dorado),Lava Cap,Red,Estate Bottled,Cabernet Franc,"El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, California, US",15.2%,$40,94,Jim Gordon,"This is a serious, age-worthy wine that's big in structure yet refined in texture and generous in black-fruit flavors while staying firm, dry and a touch restrained. It's easy to appreciate its layers of dark chocolate, black fig, dark cherry, mint and tobacco that are framed by fine-grained tannins. Best from 2026."
Zanoli 2016 Glenrose Vineyard Rows RR &amp; SS Syrah (Adelaida District),Zanoli,Red,Glenrose Vineyard Rows RR & SS,,"Adelaida District, Central Coast, California, US",13%,$52,89,Matt Kettmann,"Deep black-plum and blackberry aromas make for a hearty nose on this bottling, which comes from two specific rows.

It is dense with big tannins but also with fine spice, rich black-fruit flavors and great concentration. It is a powerful wine that, with its tannins, should age further. Drink from late 2019."
O 2007 Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),O,Red,Red,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,,87,Paul Gregutt,"Firm, tart berry fruit, annotated with dried herb and leaf.

Silvio Grasso 2006 Ciabot Manzoni  (Barolo),Silvio Grasso,Red,Ciabot Manzoni,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",,,94,,"Barolo Ciabot Manzoni is a tremendous wine with rich notes of cherry, vanilla and chocolate. Yes, it's a bold, modern wine but there's no denying the quality and beauty here. Give it more time in the cellar to allow those oak notes to integrate and give more prominence to the sophisticated aromas of wild berries, mineral, cola and licorice that are generously present. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers."

Bright flavors of dark-purple fruit are leveled by a chalky mouthfeel, solid structure and ample acid."
Mariposa 2016 Rosé (Central Coast),Mariposa,Rose,,Rosé,"Central Coast, Central Coast, California, US",13.1%,$20,86,Matt Kettmann,"This pale pink to slightly orange rosé shows tangerine, cantaloupe, cherry and sand aromas on the somewhat muddled nose. It's light in texture and a little flat on the palate but presents enjoyable squeezed lemon and watermelon flavors."
Domaine René Bouvier 2011  Fixin,Domaine René Bouvier,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Fixin, Burgundy, France",,,91,Roger Voss,"The big tannins indicate a wine with powerful potential. It has weight, richness, generous red fruits and a strong sense of structure. The freshness of the vintage comes through in the acidity at the end. Drink from 2018."
McManis 2017 Petite Sirah (California),McManis,Red,,Petite Sirah,"California, California Other, California, US",13.5%,$10,86,Jim Gordon,"Aromas of smoke and rubber dominate on the nose of this rich and full-bodied wine. It has an earthy streak on the palate, too, but it has a fruit core that makes it enjoyable nonetheless."
